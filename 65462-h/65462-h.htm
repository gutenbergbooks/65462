<p>It is important that an elementary treatise,—more particularly if
it profess to be a popular one, intended for the use of beginners as
well as for professional students,—should not only give rules, but
explain principles also; and unless the latter be clearly defined,
the memory alone is exercised, perhaps fatigued, owing to the former
being unsupported by adequate reasoning. To confine instruction to
bare matter-of-fact is not to simplify, much less to popularize it;
since such mode entirely withholds all that explanation which is so
necessary for a beginner, who will else probably feel more disheartened
than interested. Any study which is presented in its very driest form
by being divested of all that imparts interest to the subject, will
soon become dry and uninteresting in itself, and prejudice may thus be
excited against it at the very outset.</p>

<p>Those who pursue the profession of Architecture must of course apply
themselves to the study of it technically, and acquire their knowledge
of it, both theoretical and practical, by methods which partake more or
less of routine instruction. Others neither will nor even can do so.
If the public are ever to become acquainted with Architecture,—not,
indeed, with its scientific and mechanical processes of construction,
but in its character of Fine Art and Design,—other methods of study
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
than those hitherto provided must be furnished, as it appears to
have been assumed that those alone who have been educated to it
professionally can properly understand any thing of even the <i>Art</i>
of Architecture,—a fatal mistake, which, had it clearly perceived its
own interest, the Profession itself would long since have attempted to
remove; it being clearly to the interest of Architects that the public
should acquire a taste and relish for Architecture.</p>

<p>The study of Architecture, it may be said, has of late years acquired
an increased share of public attention; but it has been too exclusively
confined to the Mediæval and Ecclesiastical styles, which have
consequently been brought into repute and general favour,—a result
which strongly confirms what has just been recommended, namely, the
policy of diffusing architectural taste as widely as possible. As
yet, the taste for Architecture and the study of it, so promoted, has
not been duly extended; for next to that of being acquainted with the
Mediæval, the greatest merit, it would seem, is that of being ignorant
of Classical Architecture and its Orders; which last, however ill they
may have been understood, however greatly corrupted and perverted,
influence and pervade, in some degree, the Modern Architecture of all
Europe, and of all those countries also to which European civilization
has extended. Nevertheless, no popular Manual on the subject of the
Orders has yet been provided,—a desideratum which it is the object of
the following pages to supply.</p>

   <h2 class="nobreak" id="ORDERS">THE ORDERS.</h2>

<p>Although this little treatise is limited to the consideration of
Ancient and Classic Architecture, we may be allowed to explain
briefly what is to be understood by Architecture in its quality of
one of the so-called Fine Arts, if only to guard against confused
and erroneous notions and misconceptions. It will therefore not be
deemed superfluous to state that there is a wide difference between
Building and Architecture,—one which is apparently so very obvious
that it is difficult to conceive how it can have been overlooked, as
it generally has been, by those who have written upon the subject.
Without building we cannot have architecture, any more than without
language we can have literature; but building and language are
only the <i>matériel</i>,—neither, the art which works upon that
<i>matériel</i>, nor the productions which it forms out of it.
Building is <i>not</i> a fine art, any more than mere speaking or
writing is eloquence or poetry. Many have defined architecture to
be the art of building according to rule: just as well might they
define eloquence to be the art of speaking according to grammar,
or poetry the art of composing according to prosody. Infinitely
more correct and rational would it be to say that architecture is
building greatly refined upon,—elevated to the rank of art by being
treated <i>æsthetically</i>, that is to say, artistically. In short,
architecture is building with something more than a view to mere
utility and convenience; it is building in such a manner as to delight
the eye by beauty of forms, to captivate the imagination, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
satisfy that faculty of the mind which we denominate taste. Further
than this we shall not prosecute our remarks on the nature of
architecture, but come at once to that species of it which is
characterized by the Orders.</p>

<p>In its architectural meaning, the term <span class="allsmcap">ORDER</span>
refers to the system of columniation practised by the Greeks and Romans, and
is employed to denote the columns and entablature together; in other
words, both the upright supporting pillars and the horizontal beams and
roof, or <i>trabeation</i>, supported by them. These two divisions,
combined, constitute an Order; and so far all Orders are alike, and
might accordingly be reduced to a single one, although, for greater
convenience, they are divided into <i>three</i> leading classes or
families, distinguished as Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. It was
formerly the fashion to speak of the <span class="allsmcap">FIVE ORDERS</span>,
and also to treat of them as if each Order were reduced to a positive standard,
admitting of very little deviation, instead of being in reality
included in many subordinate varieties, which, however they may differ
from each other, are all formed according to one common type, and are
thereby plainly distinguished from either of the two other Orders. The
vulgar Five Orders’ doctrine is, it is to be hoped, now altogether
exploded; for if the so-called Tuscan, which is only a ruder and
bastard sort of Doric, and of which no accredited ancient examples
remain, is to be received as a distinct Order, a similar distinction
ought to be established between the original Ancient or Grecian and the
derivative Roman and Italian Doric, which differ from the other quite
as much, if not more so, than the Tuscan does from either. Even the
Grecian Doric itself exhibits many decided varieties, which, though
all partaking of one and the same style, constitute so many Doric
Orders. The Pæstum-Doric, for instance, is altogether dissimilar from
the Athenian or that of the Parthenon. Again, if the Composite is to
be received as a distinct Order from the Corinthian, merely on account
of its capital being of a mixed character, partaking of the Ionic,
inasmuch as it has volutes, and of the Corinthian in its foliage, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Corinthian itself may with equal propriety be subdivided into as many
distinct Orders as there are distinct varieties; and the more so, as
some of the latter vary from each other very considerably in many
other respects than as regards their capitals. Except that the same
general name is applied to them, there is very little in common between
such an example of the Corinthian or foliaged-capital class as that
of the monument of Lysicrates, and that of the Temple at Tivoli, or
between either of them or those of the Temple of Jupiter Stator and
the Pantheon, not to mention a great many others. Instances of the
so-called Composite are, moreover, so exceedingly few, as not even to
warrant our calling it the <i>Roman Order</i>, just as if it had been
in general use among the Romans in every period of their architecture.
With far greater propriety might the Corinthian itself, or what we now
so designate, be termed the Roman Order, being not only the one chiefly
used by that people, but also the one which they fairly appropriated
to themselves, by entering into the spirit of it, and treating it with
freedom and artistic feeling. In fact, we are indebted far more to
Roman than to Grecian examples for our knowledge of the Corinthian; and
it is upon the former that the moderns have modelled their ideal of
that Order.</p>

<p>What has been said with regard to striking diversity in the several
examples of the Corinthian, holds equally good as to those of the
Ionic Order, in which we have to distinguish not only between Roman
and Grecian Ionic, but further, between Hellenic and Asiatic Ionic.
Nor is that all: there is a palpable difference between those examples
whose capitals have a <i>necking</i> to them, and those which have
none,—a difference quite as great, if not greater, than that which is
recognized as sufficient to establish for the Composite the title of
a distinct Order from the Corinthian; inasmuch as the necking greatly
enlarges the proportion of the whole capital, and gives increased
importance to it. The Ionic capital further admits of a species of
variation which cannot possibly take place in those of either of the
other two Orders: it may have either <i>two faces</i> and two baluster
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
sides, or four equal and similar sides,—the volutes being, in the
latter case, turned diagonally, the mode chiefly practised by the
Romans; but by the Greeks, and that not always, in the capitals at the
ends of a portico, by placing the diagonal volute at the angle only, so
as to obtain two outer faces for the capital, one in front, the other
on the ‘return’ or flank of the portico.</p>

<p>It is therefore unnecessary to say, that to divide the Orders into
<i>Five</i>, as has been done by all modern writers, until of late
years, and to establish for each of them one fixed, uniform character,
is altogether a mistake; and not only a mere mistake as regards names
and other distinctions, but one which has led to a plodding, mechanical
treatment of the respective Orders themselves, nothing being left
for the Architect to do, so far as the Order which he employs is
concerned, than merely to follow the example which he has selected,—in
other words, merely to <i>copy</i> instead of <i>designing</i>, by
<i>imitating</i> his model with artistic freedom and spirit. Our view
of the matter, on the contrary, greatly simplifies and rationalizes the
doctrine of the Orders, and facilitates the study of them by clearing
away the contracted notions and prejudices which have been permitted to
encumber it; and owing to which, mere conventional rules, equally petty
and pedantic, have been substituted for intelligent guiding maxims and
principles.</p>

<p>Having thus far briefly explained the rationale of the Orders with
regard to the division of them into three leading <i>classes</i>, each
of which, distinct from the other two, yet comprises many varieties or
<i>species</i>,—which, however much they may differ with respect to
minor distinctions, all evidently belong to one and the same style, or
what we call Order,—we have now to consider their constituent parts,
that is, those which apply to every Order alike. Hitherto it has been
usual with most writers to treat of an Order as consisting of three
principal parts or divisions, viz. pedestal, column, and entablature.
The first of these, however, cannot by any means be regarded as an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
integral part of an Order. So far from being an essential, it is
only an <i>accidental</i> one,—one, moreover, of Roman invention,
and applicable only under particular circumstances. The pedestal no
more belongs to an Order than an attic or <i>podium</i> placed above
the entablature. In the idea of an Order we do not include what is
extraneous to the Order itself: it makes no difference whether the
columns stand immediately upon the ground or floor, or are raised above
it. They almost invariably are so raised, because, were the columns to
stand immediately upon the ground or a mere pavement, the effect would
be comparatively mean and unsatisfactory; the edifice would hardly seem
to stand firmly, and, for want of apparent footing, would look as if
it had sunk into the ground, or the soil had accumulated around it.
With the view, therefore, of increasing height for the whole structure,
and otherwise enhancing its effect, the Greeks placed their temples
upon a bold substructure, composed of <i>gradini</i> or deep steps, or
upon some sort of continuous <i>stylobate</i>; either of which modes
is altogether different from, and affords no <i>precedent</i> for, the
pedestal of modern writers. And here it may be remarked, that of the
dignity imparted to a portico by a stylobate forming an ascent up to
it in front, we have a fine example in that of St. George’s Church,
Bloomsbury, which so far imitates the celebrated Maison Carrée at
Nismes. Nevertheless, essential as some sort of stylobate is to the
edifice itself, it does not properly belong to it, any more than that
equally essential—in fact more indispensable part—the roof.</p>

<p>It is not without some regret that we abandon, as wholly untenable,
the doctrine of the pedestal being an integral part of an Order: it
would be so much more agreeable to say that the entire Order consists
of three principal divisions, just the same as each of the divisions
themselves. As regards the entire structure, such triplicity, that of
‘beginning, middle, and end,’ was observed. For ‘beginning,’ there was
substructure, however denominated, or whether expressly denominated at
all, or not; for ‘middle,’ there were the columns; and for ‘end’ or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
completion, the entablature. For the whole of a structure, there is
or ought to be such ‘beginning, middle, and end;’ but from the Order
itself we exclude one of them, as not being dependent upon it either
for character or treatment.</p>

<p>The pedestal being discarded as something apart from the Order itself,
the latter is reduced to the two grand divisions of column and
entablature, each of which is subdivided into three distinct parts
or members, viz. the column, into <i>base</i>, <i>shaft</i>, and
<i>capital</i>; the entablature, into <i>architrave</i>, <i>frieze</i>,
and <i>cornice</i>; so that the latter is to the entablature what the
capital is to the column, namely, its crowning member,—that which
completes it to the eye. Yet, although the above divisions of column
and entablature hold good with regard to the general idea of an Order,
the primitive Greek or Doric one does not answer to what has just
been said, inasmuch as it has no base,—that is, no mouldings which
distinctly mark the foot of the column as a separate and ornamented
member. Hence it will perhaps be thought that this Order is not
so complete as the others, since it wants that member below which
corresponds with the capital above. Still the Grecian Doric column is
complete in itself: it needs no base,—in fact, does not admit of such
addition without forfeiting much of its present character, and thus
becoming something different. Were there a distinct base, the mouldings
composing it could not very well exceed what is now the lower diameter
or actual foot of the column; because, were it to do so, either the
base would become too bulky in proportion to the capital, or the latter
must be increased so as to make it correspond in size with the enlarged
lower extremity. Even then that closeness of <i>intercolumniation</i>
(spacing of the columns), which contributes so much to the majestic
solidity that characterizes the genuine Doric, could not be observed;
unless the columns were put considerably further apart, the bases
would scarcely allow sufficient passage between them. The only way of
escaping from these objections and difficulties is by making the shaft
of the column considerably more slender, so that what was before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
measure of the lower diameter of the shaft itself, becomes that of
the base. That can be done—has been done, at least something like
it; but the result is an attenuated Roman or Italian Doric, differing
altogether in proportions from the original type or order. The shaft
no longer tapers visibly upwards, or, what is the same thing, expands
below.</p>

<p>Before we come to speak of the Orders severally and more in detail,
there are some other matters which require to be noticed; one of which
is the origin of the Greek system of columniation, or the prototype
upon which it was modelled. Following Vitruvius, nearly all writers
have agreed to recognize in the columnar style of the ancients the
primitive timber hut, as furnishing the first hints for and rudiments
of it. Such theory, it must be admitted, is sufficiently plausible, if
only because it can be made to account very cleverly for many minor
circumstances. Unfortunately, it does not account at all for, or rather
is in strong contradiction to, the character of the earliest extant
monuments of Greek architecture. Timber construction would have led to
very different proportions and different taste. Had the prototype or
model been of that material, slenderness and lightness, rather than
ponderosity and solidity, would have been aimed at; and the progressive
changes in the character of the Orders would have been reversed, since
the earliest of them all would also have been the lightest of them
all. The principles of stone construction have so evidently dictated
and determined the forms and proportions of the original Doric style,
as to render the idea of its being fashioned upon a model in the other
material little better than an absurd though time-honoured fiction.
Infinitely more probable is it, that the Greeks derived their system of
architecture from the Egyptians; because, much as it differs from that
of the latter people with regard to taste and matters of ornamentation,
it partakes very largely of the same <i>constitutional</i> character.
At any rate the doctrine of a timber origin applies as well to the
Egyptian as to the Hellenic or Grecian style. Indeed, if there be any
thing at all that favours such doctrine, it is, that construction with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
blocks of stone would naturally have suggested <i>square</i> pillars
instead of round ones; the latter requiring much greater labour and
skill to prepare them than the others. But, as their pyramids and
obelisks sufficiently testify, the most prodigal expenditure of labour
was not at all regarded by the Egyptians. That, it will perhaps be
said, still does not account for the adoption of the circular or
cylindrical form for columns. We have therefore to look for some
sufficiently probable motive for the adoption of that form; and we
think that we find it in <i>convenience</i>. In order to afford due
support to the massive blocks of stone placed upon them, the columns
were not only very bulky in proportion to their height, but were placed
so closely together, not only in the fronts of porticoes, but also
within them, that they would scarcely have left any open space. Such
inconvenience was accordingly remedied by making the pillars round
instead of square. Should such conjectural reason for the adoption of
circular columns be rejected, it is left to others to propound a more
satisfactory one, or to abide, as many probably will do, by the old
notion of columns being so shaped in order to imitate the stems of
trees. It is enough that whatever accounts for the columns being round
in Egyptian architecture, accounts also for their being the same in
that of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Among other fanciful notions entertained with regard to columns and
their proportions, is that of the different orders of columns being
proportioned in accordance with the human figure. Thus the Doric column
is said to represent a robust male figure, and those of the two other
Orders, female ones,—the Ionic, a matron; the Corinthian, a less
portly specimen of feminality. Now, so far from there being any general
similitude between a Grecian Doric column and a robust man, their
proportions are directly opposite,—the greater diameter of the column
being at its foot, while that of the man is at his shoulders. The one
tapers <i>upwards</i>, the other <i>downwards</i>. If the human figure
and its proportions had been considered, columns would, in conformity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
with such type, have been wider at the top of their shafts than below,
and would have assumed the shape of a terminus,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
or of a mummy-chest. With regard to the other two Orders, it is
sufficient to observe, that if so borrowed at all, the idea must have
been preposterous. We happen to have a well-known example of statues
or human figures, and those, moreover, female ones, being substituted
for columns beneath an entablature; and so far are they from confirming
the pretended analogy between the Ionic column and the proportions of a
female, that they decidedly contradict it, those figures being greatly
bulkier in their general mass than the bulkiest and stoutest columns
of the Doric Order. At any rate, one hypothesis might satisfy those
who will not be satisfied without some fancy of the kind, because two
together do not agree: if columns originated in the imitation of stems
of trees, we can dispense with the imitation of men and women, and
<i>vice versá</i>.</p>

<p>Some may think that it is hardly worth while to notice such mere
fancies; yet it is surely desirable to attempt to get rid of them by
exposing their absurdity, more especially as they still continue to
be gravely brought forward and handed down traditionally by those who
write upon the Orders, or who, if they do not actually <i>write</i>,
repeat what others have written. It is worth while to clear away, if
possible, and that, too, at the very outset of the study, erroneous
opinions, prejudices, and misconceptions. We do not pretend to explain
and trace, step by step, the progress of the Doric Order, and of
the columnar system of the Greeks, from their first rudiments and
formation. We have only the results of such progressive development or
formation; of the actual formation itself we neither know nor can now
ever know any thing. The utmost that can now be done is to take the
results themselves, and from them to reason backwards to causes and
motives. Adopting such a course, we may first observe, that there is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
very striking and characteristic difference between Egyptian and
Grecian taste and practice in one respect: in the former style the
columns are invariably <i>cylindrical</i>, or nearly so,—in the other
they are <i>conical</i>, that is, taper upwards, and in some instances
so much so, that were they prolonged to double their height, they would
be almost perfect cones, and terminate like a spire. This tapering
greatly exceeds that of the stems of trees, taking for their stem the
trunk, from above which the branches begin to shoot out. It appears
to have been adopted for purely artistic reasons, certainly not for
the sake of any positive advantage, since the diminution of the shaft,
and the great contraction of the diameter just below the capital, must
rather decrease than at all add to the strength of the column. What,
then, are the artistic qualities so obtained? We reply,—variety and
contrast, and the expression of strength without offensive heaviness.
The sudden or very perceptible diminution of the shaft,—it must be
borne in mind that our remarks refer exclusively to the original Greek
style or Doric Order,—produces a double effect; it gives the column
an expression of greater stability than it otherwise would, combined
with comparative lightness. What is <i>diminution</i> upwards, is also
<i>expansion</i> downwards; and similar difference and contrast take
place also with respect to the intercolumns, although in a reverse
manner, such intercolumns being wider at top than at bottom. So far the
principle of contrast here may be said to be twofold, although one of
the two sorts of contrast inevitably results from the other. Were it
not for the great diminution of the shaft, the columns would appear to
be too closely put together, and the intercolumns much too narrow, that
is, according, at least, to the mode of intercolumniation practised by
the Greeks in most of their structures in the Doric style; whereas such
offensive appearance was avoided by the shaft being made considerably
smaller at top than at bottom,—consequently the intercolumns wider
above than below, in the same ratio; so that columns which at their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
bases were little more than one diameter apart, became more than two,
that is, two upper diameters apart at the top of their shafts, or the
neckings of their capitals. In this style every thing was calculated
to produce a character of majestic simplicity,—varying, however, or
rather progressing, from heaviness and stern severity to comparative
lightness of proportions,—for examples differ greatly in that respect:
in some of the earlier ones the columns are not more than four
diameters in height, while in some of the later they are upwards of
six, which last-mentioned proportions not only amount to slenderness,
but also destroy others. The capital itself may be proportioned the
same as before relatively to the diameter of the column, but it cannot
possibly bear the same ratio as before to its height. The average
proportions for that member are one diameter for its width at its
abacus, and half a diameter for its depth: consequently, if the entire
column be only four diameters in height, the capital is ⅛th of it,
or equal to ⅐th of the shaft; whereas, if the column be six or more
diameters, the capital becomes only ¹/₁₂th of the column, or even less,
so that the latter appears thin and attenuated, and the other member
too small and insignificant. Yet though the original Greek Order or
style exhibits considerable diversity with respect to mere proportions,
it was otherwise very limited in its powers of expression, and moreover
something quite distinct from the nominal Doric of the Romans and the
Italians, as will be evident when we come to compare the latter with it.</p>

<p>Before we enter upon this part of our subject, and previous to an
examination of the details of the several Orders, it should be observed
that the diameter, that is, the <i>lower</i> diameter of the column,
is the standard by which all the other parts and members of an Order
are measured. The diameter is divided into 60 <i>minutes</i>, or into
two halves or <i>modules</i> of 30 minutes each; and those minutes are
again subdivided into parts or <i>seconds</i> when extreme accuracy of
measurement is required; which two last are noted thus: 5′ 10″, for
instance, meaning five minutes and ten seconds.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ANC_DORIC">DORIC ORDER.</h2>

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/image014.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="601" />
</div>

<p>It has been already observed, that in the genuine Doric the column
consists of only shaft and capital, which latter is composed of merely
an <i>echinus</i> and <i>abacus</i>, the first being a circular convex
moulding, spreading out beneath the other member, which, although a
very important one, is no more than a plain and shallow square block
upon which the architrave rests, not only firmly and safely, but so
that the utmost expression of security is obtained, and pronounced
emphatically to the eye. Such expression arises from the abacus being
larger than the <i>soffit</i> or under surface of the architrave
itself; and as the former corresponds, or nearly so, with the lower
diameter of the shaft, it serves to make evident at a glance that the
foot of the column is greater than the soffit of the architrave placed
upon the columns. Thus, as measured at either extremity, the column is
greater than the depth or thickness of the architrave, and projects
beyond the architrave and general plane of the entablature. Now this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
would produce a most unsightly effect were the columns of the same, or
nearly the same diameter throughout. In such case they would appear not
only too large, but most clumsily so, and the entablature would have
the look of being set back in the most awkward and most unaccountable
manner. Instead of which, the architrave, and consequently the general
plane of the whole entablature, actually overhangs the upper part
of the shaft, in a plane about midway between the smallest diameter
of the column, just below the capital and the face of the abacus.
Even this, the overhanging of the entablature, would be not a little
offensive to the eye, were the abacus no larger than the architrave is
deep; whereas, being larger, it projects forwarder than the face of
the architrave, thereby producing a powerful degree of one species of
æsthetic effect, namely, contrast,—and if contrast, of course variety
also; for though there may be variety without contrast, there cannot
be contrast without variety. Another circumstance to be considered is,
that were not such projection beyond the face of the architrave given
to the abacus, that and the rest of the capital could not correspond
with the foot of the shaft, and thus equalize the two extremities of
the entire column. As now managed, all contradictions are reconciled,
and the different sorts of contrast are made to contribute to and
greatly enhance general harmony. In the outline of the column we
perceive, first, contraction,—then expansion, and that in both
directions,—for in like manner as the column diminishes upwards and
the capital expands from it, its shaft may be said to expand and
increase in bulk downwards, so as to agree with the abacus or upper
extremity.</p>

<p>Though a few exceptions to the contrary exist, the shaft of the
Doric column was generally what is technically called <i>fluted</i>,
that is, cut into a series of channels touching each other, and thus
forming a series of ridges upon its surfaces,—a mode of decoration,
we may observe, altogether the reverse of that which was practised by
the Egyptians, some of whose columns exhibit, instead of channels or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
hollows, a series of convex mouldings that give them the appearance of
being composed of very slender pillars or rods bound together. Many
have attempted, with perhaps pains-taking but idle inquiry, to account
for the origin of such fluting or channeling, supposing, among other
things, that it was derived from the cracks and crevices in the stems
of trees, or from the streakings occasioned by rain on the shafts of
the columns. Most perverse ingenuity! We do not find any thing like
such marked streakings on columns even in this rainy English climate of
ours; much less would they have been at all visible in such a climate
as that of Greece. Others have supposed that these channels were at
first intended to hold spears! that is, to prevent them from slipping
and falling down when set up against a column; than which idea it is
hardly possible for the utmost stretch of ingenuity to go farther in
absurdity.</p>

<p>We, who are less ambitious, content ourselves with supposing that the
fluting of columns was introduced and adopted principally for the sake
of effect. If other motives for doing so existed, we know them not,
nor need we care, since study of effect alone suffices to account
for such mode of decoration. By multiplying its surfaces, it gives
variety to the shaft of the column, and prevents it from showing as
a mere mass. With the same, or very nearly the same bulk and degree
of solidity as before, it causes the column to appear much less heavy
than it otherwise would do, and contributes to a pleasing diversity
of light and shade, reminding us of Titian’s ‘bunch of grapes.’ Being
upon a curved surface, the channels serve to render the circularity
of the column more apparent, since, though they are all of the same
width, they show to the eye narrower and narrower on each side of the
centre one,—no matter in what direction the column is viewed. Here
then we have variety combined with uniformity, and a certain apparent
or optical irregularity with what we know to be perfect regularity.
In the Doric Order the number of channels is either sixteen or
twenty,—afterwards increased in the other Orders to twenty-four; for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
they are invariably of an even number, capable of being divided by
four; so that there shall always be a centre flute on each side of the
column, that is, in a line with the middle of each side of the abacus.
Doric flutings are much broader and shallower than those of the Ionic
or Corinthian Orders;—broader for two reasons,—first, because they
are fewer in number; and secondly, because there are no <i>fillets</i>
or plain spaces left between them upon the surface of the shaft. Their
proportionably much greater shallowness, again, may be accounted for
equally well: were the channels deeper, not only would they seem to
cut into the shaft too much, and weaken it, but also produce much too
strong shadows; and another inconvenience would be occasioned, for the
<i>arrises</i> or ridges between the channels would become very sharp
and thin, and liable to be injured. The mode of fluting Doric columns
with mere arrises between the channels, instead of <i>fillets</i>, has
been retained by the moderns as characteristic of the Order; but as
the Order has been treated by them, it is little better than a mere
distinction, with very little regard to general character. In the
original Doric almost every part is marked by breadth, or by flatness,
or by sharpness. There are no curved mouldings or surfaces, except
the <i>cymatium</i> of the cornice and the <i>echinus</i> of the
capital, which last is generally kept exceedingly flat. The breadth and
shallowness of the channels, and the flat curves in which they commence
and terminate, are therefore in perfect keeping with the style in other
respects; so also are the sharp arrises or ridges between the channels
or flutings on the surface of the shaft, they being expressive of a
severe simplicity. The same remark applies to the horizontal annular
narrower channels or incisions immediately beneath the echinus of
the capital, and lower down, which last are just the reverse of the
projecting astragal or convex moulding given to the Doric capital by
the moderns. Why such horizontal channels or grooves should have been
cut in the very thinnest and weakest part of the column, where they
diminish instead of adding to strength, it is not easy to say, except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
that they were merely for the sake of effect,—of producing shadow,
and increasing the proportions of the capital, to which they seem to
belong. We leave others, should any be so disposed, to object that the
lowermost groove or grooves, as the case may be, give the capital the
appearance of being a separate piece, merely joined on to the shaft
without such joining being concealed. Looking at it differently, we
will rather say that such groove is intended to mark to the eye the
commencement of the capital, the portion above it of the shaft being
thereby converted into the <i>hypotrachelium</i> or necking of the
capital itself, which is thus enlarged in appearance without being
actually increased, and rendered unduly heavy. It is not, however,
every example of the Order that has such necking: while in some the
groove separating the capital from the shaft is diminished to a mere
line,—which looks like a joining not intended to show itself,—in
others it is omitted altogether. With respect to the <i>echinus</i>,
we have little more to remark than that its office—which it performs
admirably—is, by expanding out, to connect the diminished upper end of
the column with the overhanging abacus; and the former being circular
and the latter square, but adapted to each other in size, a beautiful
combination is produced of a circle inscribed within a square; and
the result is variety, contrast, and harmony. In its profile or
<i>section</i>,—by which latter term is understood the contour of any
moulding or other member,—it is usually very flat, little more than
a portion of a cone (turned downwards), with scarcely any perceptible
degree of convexity, except just beneath the abacus, where it is
suddenly rounded and diminished, so that the abacus does not seem to
press upon or compress it too much.</p>

<p>We arrive now at the entablature, the first or lowermost division
of which, the architrave, otherwise called by the Greek name of
<i>epistylium</i> (from ἐπι, upon, and στύλος, column), is no more than
a plain surface whose height, including the <i>tænia</i> or fillet
which finishes it and separates it from the frieze, is equal to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
upper diameter of the column. Such, at least, may be considered
its standard proportion, that by means of which it conforms to and
harmonizes with the column itself. The second or middle division of the
entablature, namely, the frieze, constitutes in the Doric style a very
characteristic feature of the Order, being invariably distinguished by
its triglyphs and metopes. The former of these are upright channeled
blocks, affixed to or projecting from the frieze, and are supposed to
have been originally intended to represent the ends of inner beams
laid upon the architrave transversely to it. The <i>metopes</i>, on
the contrary, are not actually architectural members, but merely the
intervals or spaces between the triglyphs; so that without the latter
there could not be the others, because it is the triglyphs which
produce the metopes. With slight variations in different examples, the
frieze is of about the same height as the architrave,—a trifle less,
rather than more; and the average proportion for the breadth of the
triglyphs is the mean diameter of the column, or that taken midway of
the shaft. The face of the triglyph has two <i>glyphs</i> or channels
carved upon it, and its edges beveled off into a half channel, thus
making what is equal to a third glyph, whence the name triglyph, or
<i>three-channeled</i>. We have till now reserved speaking of what,
although it shows itself upon the architrave, belongs to the triglyph,
and is in continuation of it, namely, the fillet and <i>guttæ</i>
attached to the tænia of the architrave immediately beneath each
triglyph, and corresponding with it in width. These small conical guttæ
or <i>drops</i> are supposed, rather whimsically, by some to represent
drops of rain that have trickled down the channels of the triglyph, and
settled beneath the ledge of the architrave. Others suppose them to
have been intended to indicate the heads of nails, screws, or studs.
Leaving all such suppositions to those who have a taste for them, we
will be satisfied with discerning artistic intention and æsthetic
effect. That member of the triglyph,—for such we must be allowed
to consider it,—is of great value, serving, as it does, to impart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
somewhat of decoration to the architrave, to break the monotony of
the otherwise uninterrupted line of the tænia, and to connect, to the
eye at least, the architrave and frieze together. Although in a much
fainter degree, the architrave is thus made to exhibit the same system
of placing ornamental members at regular distances from each other, as
is so energetically pronounced in the frieze itself. If it be asked
why the same, or something equivalent to it, was not extended to the
architrave in the other Orders, our answer is, because a similar motive
for doing it does not exist. The triglyph being suppressed in the
Ionic and Corinthian frieze, the accompanying guttæ beneath it were of
necessity omitted also, otherwise they would have made evident that
the triglyph ought to have been shown likewise. There is, indeed, one
example, the monument of Thrasyllus, of a Grecian Doric entablature,
whose frieze is without triglyphs (wreaths being substituted for
them), and the guttæ are nevertheless retained. But how?—instead
of being placed at intervals, as if there were triglyphs, they are
continued uninterruptedly throughout, so that the idea of triglyph
disappears; besides which, the example here referred to is altogether
so anomalous and exceptional as to be not so much a specimen of the
Doric <i>Order</i> as of the Doric <i>style</i>, modified according to
particular circumstances; on which account it is highly valuable, since
we may learn from it that where peculiar circumstances required—at
least admitted of peculiar treatment, the Greeks did not scruple to
avail themselves of the liberty so afforded.</p>

<p>With regard to the arrangement of the triglyphs, one is placed
over every column, and one or more intermediately over every
<i>intercolumn</i> (or space between two columns), at such distance
from each other that the metopes are square; in other words, the height
of the triglyph is the measure for the distance between it and the next
one. In the best Greek examples of the Order there is only a single
triglyph over each intercolumn, whence that mode is sometimes called
<i>monotriglyphic</i> or single-triglyphed intercolumniation; which is
the closest of all, the distance from axis to axis of the columns being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
limited to the space occupied above by two metopes and two triglyphs,
<i>i. e.</i> one whole triglyph and two halves of triglyphs. In such
intercolumniation the number of the triglyphs is double the number
of the columns, minus one. Further, it is evident that as there must
be a triglyph over every column, the triglyphs must regulate the
intercolumniation. The width of the intercolumns cannot be at all less
than the proportion above mentioned; neither can it be increased,
except by introducing a second triglyph,—and if a second triglyph, a
second metope also, over each intercolumn, thus augmenting the distance
between the columns to half as much again, which becomes, perhaps, too
much, the difference between that and the other mode being considerably
more than the diameter of a column; whereas in the other Orders the
intercolumns may be made, at pleasure, either a little wider or a
little narrower than usual. One peculiarity of the Grecian Doric frieze
is, that the end triglyphs, instead of being, like the others, in the
same axis or central line as the columns beneath, are placed quite up
to the edge or outer angle of the frieze. In itself this is, perhaps,
rather a defect than the contrary, although intended to obviate another
defect,—that of a half metope or blank space there,—for it produces
not only some degree of irregularity, but of æsthetic inconsistency
also, the triglyph so placed being, as it were, on one side of, instead
of directly over the column. One advantage attending it is, that the
extreme intercolumns become in consequence narrower than the others by
half a triglyph, and accordingly a greater degree and expression of
strength is given to the extremities of a portico.</p>

<p>The Doric <i>Cornice</i>.—The third and last division of the
entablature which remains to be considered is, although exceedingly
simple, strongly characteristic, and boldly marked. With regard to its
proportions, it is about a third or even more than a third less than
the other two, and may itself be divided into three principal parts
or members, viz. the <i>corona</i>, with the <i>mutules</i> and other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
<i>bed-mouldings</i>, as they are termed, beneath it and the
<i>epitithedas</i> above it. The mutules are thin plates or shallow
blocks attached to the under side or soffit of the corona, over each
triglyph and each metope, with the former of which they correspond in
breadth, and their soffits or under-surfaces are wrought into three
rows of <i>guttæ</i> or drops, conical or otherwise shaped, each row
consisting of six guttæ, or the same number as those beneath each
triglyph. Nothing can be more artistically disposed: in like manner,
as an intermediate triglyph is placed over every two columns, so is
an intermediate mutule over every two triglyphs. The smaller members
increase in number as they decrease in size; and in the upper and
finishing part of the Order, the eye is led on horizontally, instead
of being confined vertically to the lines indicated by the columns
below. The corona is merely a boldly projecting flat member, not
greatly exceeding in its depth the abacus of the capital; in some
examples it is even less. The epitithedas, or uppermost member of the
cornice, is sometimes a cymatium, or <i>wavy</i> moulding, convex below
and concave above; sometimes an echinus moulding, similar in profile
to the echinus of the capital. The cornice may be said to be to the
entablature, and indeed to the whole Order, what the capital is to the
column,—completing and concluding it in a very artistic manner. By
its projection and the shadow which it casts, the cornice gives great
spirit and relief to the entablature, which would else appear both
heavy and unfinished. In the horizontal cornice beneath a pediment,
the epitithedas is omitted, and shows itself only in the sloping or
<i>raking</i> cornices, as they are called, along the sides of the
pediment.</p>

<p><i>Antæ.</i>—Pilasters, as well as columns, belong to an Order,
and in modern practice are frequently substituted indifferently for
columns, where the latter would be <i>engaged</i> or attached to a
wall. In Grecian architecture, however, the <i>antæ</i>,—as they are
thus termed, to distinguish them from other pilasters,—are never so
employed. They are never placed consecutively, or in any series, but
merely as a facing at the end of a projecting wall, as where a portico
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
is enclosed at each end by the walls forming the sides of the
structure, in which case it is described as a portico <i>in antis</i>.
Although they accompany columns, and in the case just mentioned
range in the same line with them, antæ differ from them, inasmuch as
their shafts are not diminished; for which reason their faces are
not made so wide as the diameter of the columns, neither are their
capitals treated in the same manner, as both shaft and capital would
be exceedingly clumsy. The expanding echinus of the column capital
is therefore suppressed, and one or more very slightly projecting
<i>faciæ</i>, the uppermost of which is frequently hollowed out below,
so as to form in section what is called the ‘bird’s beak’ moulding. In
a portico <i>in antis</i> the want of greater congruity between the
antæ and the columns is made up for by various contrasts. Flatness
of surface is opposed to rotundity, vertical lines to inclined ones
(those of the outline and flutings of the column), and uniformity,
in regard to light, to the mingled play of light and shade on the
shafts of the columns. Instead of attempting to keep up similarity
as far as possible, the Greeks made a studied distinction between
antæ and columns, not only in those respects which have been noted
above, but carried difference still further, inasmuch as they never
channeled the faces of their antæ, whereas the moderns flute their
pilasters as well as columns. Hardly was such marked distinction a mere
arbitrary fashion; it is more rational to suppose that it was adopted
for sufficient æsthetic reasons and motives; nor is it difficult to
account, according to them, for the omission of channeling on the
shafts of antæ. Upon a plain surface the <i>arrises</i> between the
channels would have occasioned an unpleasing harshness and dryness
of effect, as is the case with fluted Doric pilasters, and would
have been attended with monotony also, the lines being all vertical,
and consequently parallel to each other; whereas in the column, the
channels diminish in breadth upwards, and all the lines are inclined,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and instead of being parallel, converge towards each other, so that
were the shaft sufficiently prolonged, they would at last meet in
a common point or apex similar to that of a spire. Owing to this
convergency, the lines on one side of a vertical line dividing the
column, or rather a geometrical drawing or <i>elevation</i> of it,
into two halves, instead of being parallel, are opposed to each other,
like the opposite sides of an isosceles triangle; and this opposition
produces <i>correspondence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pediment.</span>—In addition to what has been already said
relative to this very important feature of Grecian architecture, some further
remarks will not be at all superfluous. In the first place, then,
the pediment proves to us most convincingly that a figure which,
considered merely in itself, is generally regarded as neither beautiful
nor applicable to architectural purposes, may be rendered eminently
beautiful and satisfactory to the eye. Reasoning abstractedly, it
would seem that if such figure is to be made use of at all, the
<i>equilateral</i> triangle would recommend itself in preference to
any other, as being obviously the most perfect and regular of all
triangles. For a pediment, however, such form would be truly monstrous;
and yet even the equilateral triangle, or even one of still loftier
pitch, may, under some circumstances, become a pleasing architectural
form, as we may perceive from pyramids and Gothic gables. How, then,
is this seeming inconsistency or contradiction to be explained? It
explains itself, if we merely reflect, as we ought to do, that in
architecture, forms and proportions are beautiful not <i>positively</i>
but only <i>relatively</i>. Were it not so, the same forms and
proportions would be beautiful, and equally so under all circumstances,
without any regard to purpose or propriety. It must also be taken into
account that habit, custom, association of ideas, or prejudice, greatly
influence our notions of architectural beauty. We are <i>prejudiced</i>
in favour of the low Greek pediment, if for no other reason, because it
is sanctioned by Greek authority and is according to Greek precedent.
In all probability, had that people employed high-pitched instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
low-pitched pediments, we should, without inquiring further, have
admired the former rather than the latter. What we have now to inquire
is, why lowness of pitch for the pediment best agrees with the
Greek system and its principles. Notwithstanding that the pediment
forms no part of the Order, since the latter is complete without
it,—and in fact the pediment occurs only at the ends of a sloping
roof,—the pediment must, when it does appear, be in accordance with
the Order itself, or that front of the building which is beneath the
pediment; consequently the pitch of the latter must be regulated by
circumstances,—must be either greater or less, according to the
proportions of the front itself. So far from being increased in the
same ratio, the wider the front,—the greater the number of columns at
that end of the building,—the lower must the pediment be kept, because
the front itself becomes of <i>low proportions</i> in the same degree
as it is extended or widened. Under all circumstances, the height of
the pediment must remain pretty nearly the same, and be determined,
not by width or horizontal extent, but by the <i>height</i> of what
is beneath it. The height of the pediment or its <i>tympanum</i>
(the triangular surface included between the horizontal cornice of
the Order, and the two <i>raking</i> cornices of the pediment) never
greatly exceeds the depth or height of the entablature; for were it to
do so, the pediment would become too large and heavy, would take off
from the importance of the Order, and appear to load its entablature
with an extraneous mass which it was never calculated to bear.</p>

<p>We hardly need observe that it was, if not a constant, a very usual
practice with the Ancients to fill in the whole of the tympanum of the
pediment with sculpture, and also the metopes of the frieze, by which
the latter, instead of being mere blank spaces between the triglyphs,
were converted into highly ornamental features.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MOD_DORIC">MODERN DORIC.</h2>

<p>Of the Roman and the modern varieties of this Order we shall treat much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
more briefly, because our remarks may be confined to comparison and
the notice of differences. Certain it is that the original character
of the Order was gradually lost sight of more and more, till at
length it was converted into something quite different from its Greek
type. The few circumstances in which Modern Doric, as we may call it,
resembles the original one, are little more than the mode of fluting
with <i>arrises</i> instead of fillets,—the general form of capital
composed of echinus and abacus, and the triglyphs upon the frieze.
The differences are, if not greater, far more numerous. The column
becomes greatly elongated, being increased from six to eight diameters.
The sunk annulets beneath the capital were omitted or converted into
fillets; the capital was increased in depth by a distinct necking
being given to it, divided from the shaft by a projecting moulding,
which in that situation is called an <i>astragal</i>. The abacus,
too, is made shallower, and has mouldings added to it. One of the
greatest changes of all, as far as the column is concerned, is the
addition of a base to it, which is partly both consequence and cause
of the greater slenderness of the shaft; for were the shaft not
reduced in diameter,—which is the same as being made more diameters
in height,—the base added to it would enlarge the foot of the
column: so again, on the other hand, were only the shaft decreased in
thickness, without any mouldings for a base being added to it, that
end of the column would be as much too small. The base best adapted
to the Order, as being the most simple, though not uniformly made
use of, is that which consists of merely a <i>torus</i>, or large
circular and convex-sided block, and two shallow fillets above it.
It may here further be noticed, that besides the base itself, or
the base <i>proper</i>, the moderns have, for all the Orders alike,
adopted an additional member, namely, a rather deep and square block,
which, when so applied, is termed a <i>plinth</i>; and beneath this is
frequently placed another and deeper one, called a <i>sub-plinth</i>.
Contrary as this is to the practice of the Greeks, it is by no means an
unwarrantable license, for had no greater liberty been taken with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Orders and the modes of applying them, they would have remained
comparatively quite pure. In apology for the plinth beneath a base, it
may be said to produce a pleasing agreement between both extremities
of the column,—in the Doric Order at least, where the square plinth
beneath the circular torus of the base answers to the square abacus
(which is itself another plinth, though differently named) placed upon
the circular echinus of the capital.</p>

<p>Passing over several particulars which our confined limits will not
permit us to notice, we may remark, that if greatly altered, not to say
corrupted, from its primitive character, the Doric Order, as treated
by the moderns, has been assimilated to the other Orders,—so much so
as, though still differing from them in its details, to belong to the
same general style. One advantage, if no other, of which is, that it
may, should occasion require, be used along with the other Orders;
whereas the original or Grecian Doric is so obstinately inflexible
that it cannot be made to combine with any thing else, or to bend
to modern purposes. So long as a mere portico or colonnade, and
nothing more, is required, backed by a wall unperforated by windows,
its character and characteristic system of intercolumniation can be
kept up, but no longer; or if it is to be done, it is more than has
yet been accomplished. Nothing could be more preposterous, or show
greater want of proper æsthetic feeling, or greater disregard of
æsthetic principles, than the attempt to combine, as was done by Nash
in the Park façade of Buckingham Palace, a Grecian Doric Order with a
Corinthian one. So totally irreconcileable are the two <i>styles</i>,
that it was like placing Tudor or florid Perpendicular Gothic upon
the early Lancet style. Besides, in that instance, the Doric, though
affecting to be Greek, was depravated most offensively, as may still
be seen in what is now left in the two low wings, the architrave and
frieze being thrown together into one blank surface.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TUSCAN">TUSCAN ORDER.</h2>

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/image028.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="633" />
</div>

<p>This, as already stated, is not entitled to rank as a distinct Order,
being, in fact, nothing more than a simplified, if not a spurious and
debased variety of the Doric. No authentic examples of it exist: it is
known only from what Vitruvius says of it, following whose imperfect
account, modern writers and architects have endeavoured to make out
something answering to it. Yet what has been so produced is to all
intents and purposes Doric,—though not Grecian Doric,—excepting
that the shafts are unfluted and the frieze quite plain; which last
circumstance, and much more, as has just above been intimated, is
a mere trifling discrepancy, since not the triglyphs merely, but
the frieze may, it seems, be omitted without thereby forfeiting the
character of Doric for the Order. Though the Tuscan is spoken of, it is
not practised. Almost the only example of what is called by that name
in this country is Inigo Jones’s portico of St. Paul’s, Covent Garden,
which, though not devoid of character and effect, is remarkable chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
for the great width of the intercolumns, and the great projection of
its very shallow, and therefore too shelf-like cornice, which, if no
other part, must be admitted to differ widely from the comparatively
slightly projecting and massive Doric cornice. The Tuscan has, however,
been treated differently by different Architects, and some of them have
given it what is merely a modification of the Doric cornice without
its mutules. Their Tuscan becomes, in fact, very little more than a
plainer sort of their own Doric, distinguished from it chiefly, and
that only negatively, by the omission of triglyphs on the frieze.
One thing which the Moderns have done, both in their Doric and their
Tuscan, is to assimilate pilasters to columns, giving to the former
precisely the same bases and capitals as the others have, and also
generally diminishing their shafts in the same manner. Still all the
differences here pointed out, together with many minor ones besides,
do not constitute different Orders, unless they are to be multiplied
by being subdivided into almost as many distinct Orders as there are
varieties of one and the same class. All the Dorics and the Tuscan
agree in having the <i>echino-abacus capital</i>. Therefore, if we want
a quite different and distinct Order, we must turn, as we now do, to
the <i>voluted-capital</i> class of columns, or that which bears the
name of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IONIC">IONIC ORDER.</h2>

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/image030.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="724" />
</div>

<p>How this Order originated,—what first led to the adoption of volutes
as a suitable decoration for the capital,—whether they were mere
decoration, or were at first intended to express some meaning,—whether
they were intentionally devised for the latter purpose, or grew out of
some accidental hint,—must now be entirely matter of conjecture. Of
one thing we may be quite certain, that the Order as we now find it in
the best and best known examples, was not struck out all at once, but
must have passed through several stages till it was ultimately matured
into perfection.</p>

<p>Although the capital is the <i>indicial</i> mark of the Order,—that
by which the eye immediately recognizes and distinguishes it,—the
entire column is of quite a different character from the Doric. Besides
having the addition of a base, the shaft is of more slender or taller
proportions, and consequently made much less visibly tapering; for if
it diminished in the same degree as the Doric shaft does,—the Ionic
being about two diameters longer,—the upper one would, in consequence
of such tapering, become much too small; and a further consequence would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
be that the foot and base of the column would appear much too
large,—perhaps clumsily so. Not knowing expressly to the contrary, we
are at liberty to suppose that it was the altered form and character
of the capital itself which first led to the formation of a base or
series of mouldings at the bottom of the shaft, in order to produce
such degree of finish below as would correspond with and balance
the richness and flow of outline given to the capital. And it must
be allowed that the swelling contours of the base are admirably in
keeping, and harmonize with the play of curves in the volutes; whereas,
were the shaft to stand immediately upon the floor or pavement without
any base, as in the Doric Order, although such treatment is in perfect
correspondence with the character of that echino-abacus Order, it
would be just the reverse in the <i>voluted</i> one. There would be a
harshness and abruptness below, in grating discord with the graceful
flow of lines in the capital above. This feeling dictated the necessity
for a corresponding base, which, although generally spoken of as an
addition <i>to</i> the shaft, may with far greater propriety be said to
have been <i>taken out</i> of it. Any actual addition to the foot of
the shaft would have been the same as an enlargement of it, producing
disproportion, and therefore deformity. The most rational explanation
therefore is, that the original diameter for the foot of the shaft was
retained, but the foot itself shaped into mouldings, and the portion
immediately above it pared away or reduced, so that the column became
more diameters in height than before. That being done, and a distinct
base so obtained, it was found necessary to make a further change, for
the sharp arrises of the Doric mode of fluting occasioned a degree of
harshness quite at variance with the greater delicacy aimed at in other
respects. Those arrises were accordingly converted into <i>fillets</i>,
which are not actual members, but merely spaces left between the
channels or flutes themselves, which last are consequently narrower
than in the Doric column; and their comparative narrowness is further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
increased by their being augmented in number, from that of twenty
to twenty-four. Thus the change from the Doric to the Ionic column
may be accounted for, rationally at least, and æsthetically, if not
historically. We do not, indeed, profess to know and determine the
actual origin of the volutes of the capital, and therefore leave those
who put faith in Vitruvius to believe, if they can, that they were
derived from the imitation of the curls in a lady’s head-dress; or,
as others will have it, that the idea was borrowed either from rams’
horns, or the slender and flexile twigs of trees placed upon the
capital for ornament! We also leave those who are not satisfied with
our way of accounting for the base given to the Ionic column to fancy
that this member was intended to imitate the ancient <i>chaussure</i>
or sandals.</p>

<p>The Ionic capital is far more complex than that of the Doric, and
not only more complex, but more irregular also: instead of showing,
like the other, four equal sides, it exhibits two faces or fronts
parallel to the architrave above it, and two narrower <i>baluster</i>
sides, as they are termed, beneath the architrave. Some consider this
irregularity a defect, which, if such it be, is to be got over only
by either turning the volutes diagonally, as in some Roman and modern
examples, or by curving concavely the faces of the capital, instead
of making them planes, so as to obtain four equal faces or sides, as
is done in the capitals of the inner Order of the Temple of Apollo at
Bassæ. At least that method, and the other one of turning the volutes
diagonally, are the only methods that have been practised for giving
perfect regularity to the Ionic capital by means of four equal faces;
for, though difficult, it is possible to accomplish the same purpose
differently, by making the abacus quite square, as in the Doric Order,
and letting the volutes grow out of it on each side or face, their
curvature commencing not on the upper horizontal edge, but descending
from the vertical edges of the abacus. In fact, the volutes might be
fancied to have originated in a prolonged abacus, first falling down on
each side beneath the architrave, and then coiled up on the back and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
front of the column for the two faces, which thus became greater in
width; after which a smaller ornamental abacus was introduced as a
crowning member, immediately beneath the architrave. As it is now
treated, the great extent of the two flat voluted faces prevents the
capital from being square. Let us endeavour to explain this: as average
measurement, we may put down 50 minutes, or 10 less than the lower
diameter, for that of the upper diameter of the shaft; 65 for the sides
of the abacus; from 56 to 60 for the soffit of the architrave, which
last accordingly overhangs the upper part of the shaft; and 90 minutes,
that is, three modules, or a diameter and a half, for the faces of the
capital, measured across the volutes. Now, were the capital square—as
deep from back to front as it is wide in front—its bulk would be
excessive, and out of proportion with the column and other parts of the
Order, and inconsistent with the delicacy aimed at in all respects.
The mere <i>lateral</i> expansion of the capital, on the contrary, as
viewed in front, does not occasion any appearance of heaviness,—rather
that of richness; more especially as the bulk is greatly diminished by
the following ingenious expedient. Instead of the <i>baluster side</i>
being made cylindrical by being kept of the same diameter throughout,
and equal to the face of the volute, it is gradually diminished from
each face; so that the side of the capital thus becomes in a manner
hollowed out; and not only that, but great play of form is imparted to
it, and its curvature both contrasts and harmonizes with the curves of
the volutes themselves.</p>

<p>If there be not the same completeness with respect to uniformity in all
the four sides as is obtained in the Doric and Corinthian capitals,
at any rate the most admirable artistic contrivance and propriety are
exhibited. The only thing to be objected against the Ionic capital is,
that in the end columns of a portico the form of capital just described
occasioned obvious if not offensive irregularity, because on the return
or side of the building the baluster side showed itself beneath the
face of the architrave: yet even this was of little consequence if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
there was merely a single row of columns in front; but where the
colonnade was continued along the flanks of the building also, a very
unsightly sort of irregularity was produced; for while all the other
columns on those flanks showed the faces of their capitals, the end
one would show its baluster side. Here then a difficulty presented
itself that demanded some ingenuity to overcome it; and hardly can we
sufficiently admire the happy expedient by which it was surmounted. It
was necessary to give the capital at the angle two adjoining voluted
faces, so that it should agree with those of the other columns both in
front and on the flank of the building. This was accordingly effected
by placing the volute at the angle, diagonally, so as to obtain there
two voluted surfaces placed immediately back to back,—a most happy and
simple contrivance, which, now that it has been applied, every one is
at liberty to fancy he could have found out for himself. Nevertheless
it is not every one that approves of it, for there are some who affect
to regard that disposition of the volute at the angle as a defect.
If it be strictly considered merely in itself, it may, perhaps, be
objected to such capital that in itself it is irregular, one of the
volutes in each of its faces being turned obliquely and foreshortened,
while the other volute in the same face is seen directly in front,
as in all the other capitals. Yet surely such partial and trifling
irregularity may very well be excused, instead of being imputed as a
defect, since it obviates far greater irregularities, and contributes
so effectively to general harmony and symmetry. At all events, it is
incumbent upon those who make the objection to show how much better
they could have managed matters. So far are we from objecting to it,
that we do not see why the same diagonal disposition of the volutes
should not, <i>occasionally</i> at least, be employed for all the
capitals alike, thereby giving them, although in all other respects
perfectly Greek as to style, four uniform faces, as in some of the
Roman and Italian examples of the Order.</p>

<p>How little modern Architects are capable of modifying the Ionic
capital, and adapting it to particular circumstances, may be seen in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the colonnades of the façade of the British Museum, where, at the
re-entering or internal angle formed by colonnades at right angles to
each other, the column at the angle has two adjoining voluted faces
given to it; but as a re-entering or inner angle is circumstanced
quite differently from an external one, the consequence is that each
of those faces falls opposite the baluster side of the columns ranging
with it either way. We explain this briefly in two simple diagrams, in
which <i>f</i> indicates the face or voluted side of the capital, and
<i>b</i> the baluster side. In an external angle, or the return of a
portico, the faces and sides are arranged thus, so that <i>b b b b</i>
come opposite each other; but in an internal or re-entering angle, the
reverse takes place; for we have then this disposition of the faces
and sides of the capitals, in which a voluted face comes opposite to
the baluster side of the next capital,—a most unsightly irregularity,
and one all the more unpardonable because it could have been got over,
if in no other way, by converting that column (<i>a</i>) into a square
pillar, which would besides give strength, or the expression of it,
where such expression is very desirable.</p>

</div>

<p>If these observations on the Ionic capital seem to detain us too
long, we cannot help it: they are nothing less than indispensable
for a proper understanding of its nature, and the peculiarity of
circumstances attending it. What remains to be observed is, that
owing to its complexity, that capital admits of very great diversity
of character and decoration. It is sometimes without, and sometimes
has a necking to it, which may either be plain or decorated, as may
best accord with the particular expression, either as to richness
or quiet simplicity, which is aimed at as the characteristic of the
entire design. The capital may be modified almost infinitely in its
proportions; first, as regards its general proportion to the column;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
secondly, as regards the size of the volutes compared with the width
of the face. In the best Greek examples the volutes are much bolder
and larger than in those of the Roman and Italian, in some of which
they are so greatly reduced in size, and become consequently so far
apart from each other, as to be insignificant in themselves, and
give the whole capital an expression of meagreness and meanness. The
<i>spirals</i> forming the volute supply another source of variety,
since they may be either single or manifold. In what is called the
Ilissus Ionic capital there is only a single spiral, or <i>hem</i>,
whose revolutions form the volute, which mode, indeed, prevails in
all the Roman and modern Ionics; but in the capitals of the Temple
of Erechtheus at Athens, there are, besides that principal spiral,
other intermediate ones which follow the course of its revolutions.
Again, the <i>cathetus</i>, or eye of the volute, where the spiral
or spirals terminate, admits of being made smaller or larger. It is,
besides, sometimes flat, sometimes convex, and occasionally carved as
a <i>rosette</i>. All these variations are independent of the general
composition of the capital, and though not all equally good, they both
suggest and authorize other modifications of the Ionic type, and fresh
combinations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="I_37" src="images/image037.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="650" />
</div>

<p>One exceedingly interesting example, highly valuable as suggestive
study,—one quite <i>sui generis</i>, and perhaps on that account
viewed with more of prejudice than relish, is the internal Order of
the Temple of Apollo at Bassæ, delineated and described by Mr. T. L.
Donaldson, in the supplementary volume to Stuart’s ‘Athens.’ This
example, which seems to have found favour only in the eyes of Mr. C.
R. Cockerell, who has employed it on more than one occasion, has, as
already intimated, four similar faces; yet if it so far agrees with
many Roman and modern Ionic capitals, it differs from them totally
in every other respect. While the faces of the latter are formed
rather by merely <i>sticking on</i> the volutes diagonally, instead of
<i>turning</i> them, so in the example now under notice, each face may
be said to be arched, since it curves downwards on each side from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
middle of its upper edge, instead of being there straight or
horizontal beneath the architrave. Owing to this circumstance the
faces of the capital have the look of being rather affixed to than
properly connected with the abacus, and there is a certain degree of
incongruousness and want of finish. So far, then, there is room for
improvement, and perhaps in some other respects also; yet upon the
whole there is much to approve of and admire in this capital, among
whose peculiarities it deserves to be noted that the space between the
volutes is not above half the width of the volutes themselves. Nor is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
it for its capital alone this that example of the Order is remarkable,
its base being equally peculiar, on account of its simplicity of form,
and still more so, perhaps, on account of its very great expansion,
spreading out below to considerably more than two upper diameters of
the shaft; which perhaps causes the capital to appear rather too small
in comparison with it. This base is all the more remarkable because it
differs entirely from what is called the <i>Ionic base</i>, although
not employed by the European Greeks for that Order, who made use of
what is styled the <i>Attic base</i>, consisting of two <i>tori</i>
and a <i>scotia</i>, or deep curved hollow, between them. The proper
Ionic base, or what is so called, differs from every other form of
that member, being greatly contracted in its lower mouldings, which,
if not a deformity, is not a particular beauty, as it gives the base
too much the appearance of being reversed or turned upside down; and
hence it is difficult to assign any probable or sufficient motive for
such conformation of mouldings in the foot of a column. Perhaps the
only modern instance of the application of that base occurs in the
<i>tetrastyle</i> (<i>four</i>-columned) portico of Hanover Chapel,
Regent Street, whose Order is copied from the Temple of Minerva Polias
at Priene, in Asia Minor; to which example we shall presently have
occasion to refer again when we come to speak of the Ionic entablature.
Before so doing we have to call attention to another peculiarity in
the columns within the Temple at Bassæ, whose base is <a href="#I_37">above shown</a>:
we allude to the mode in which the shafts are fluted, which seems to
indicate a transition from the Doric to the Ionic style, the fillets
being exceedingly narrow, and the channels shallow and very slightly
curved, which gives the shaft altogether a different character from
that attending the usual mode of fluting practised for this Order.</p>

<p>Although it is a modern composition, derived from the study of Greek
fragments, yet certainly not on that account the less meritorious than
if it were an express copy from some one particular example, we may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
allowed to speak of the Order, or rather the columns of the
<i>hexastyle</i> (<i>six</i>-columned) portico of the Church in Regent
Square, Gray’s Inn Road, erected between twenty and thirty years ago
by Mr. Inwood, soon after the completion of St. Pancras’ Church, whose
portico so admirably exemplifies the florid and elaborately wrought
Ionic of the Temple of Erechtheus at Athens. The columns of the Regent
Square Church,—and it is on account of the columns alone that we
allude to it,—differ from all other known examples; not only in their
bases and capitals, but also in the very peculiar mode of fluting,
or rather <i>striating</i>, employed for their shafts. Not having
detailed drawings, or any drawings at all to assist us, we cannot
pretend to enter into description, but can only say that base, shaft,
and capital are unlike all received examples, and at the same time so
well adapted to each other as to produce artistic unity and consistency
of character; and that character is stamped by <i>breadth</i> and
simplicity. With respect to the fluting, it partakes of what may be
called <i>striating</i>, the fillets showing themselves rather as
narrow surfaces raised upon the shaft, than the channels as positive
hollows between them. The capital is at once graceful and simple, and
derives much of its peculiar character from the enlarged eye of the
volute, which is occupied by a rosette ornament.</p>

<p>Interesting as it would be to particularize other examples, we cannot
do so here, which is the less to be regretted because mere verbal
remarks, unaccompanied by drawings on such a scale as to fully show
all their minutiæ, would not be very satisfactory. Perhaps we shall be
thought to have already dwelt rather too long on the mere column, for
we have not yet quite done with that part of the Order. It remains to
be observed, that notwithstanding its situation is such as to render
detail there hardly noticeable, the baluster side of the capital was
always enriched. In Greek examples it had a series of wide channels
with broad fillets between them, and where great richness was affected,
as in the Ionic of the Temple of Erechtheus, the fillets had an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
additional moulding upon them, carved into beads. In the Asiatic
examples, on the contrary, and Roman ones also, the baluster side is
usually cut into the form of leaves, bound together, as it were, in
the centre by a broad moulded ring, which produces an exceedingly
good effect; and indeed, in several instances, much better taste is
manifested in that obscure part of the capital than in the face itself.</p>

<p>Although it is repetition to say that the base usually given to this
Order by the Greeks was the <i>Attic</i> one, consisting of two
<i>tori</i>, divided by a <i>scotia</i>, we here refer to that part
of the column again for the purpose of noting a species of enrichment
applied to it, the upper torus being sometimes fluted horizontally, at
others cut to resemble an interlaced chain-like ornament, now called
a <i>guilloche</i>. Modern Architects, however, invariably leave the
upper torus of the base quite plain, even when they scrupulously copy
every other part of the column. The only instance of channeling upon
the upper torus, to which we can point, is that of the portico of St.
Pancras’ Church, which building well deserves to be carefully examined
and studied by those who would acquire a correct idea of the exquisite
finish and richness of Grecian Ionic details, and their effect in
execution.</p>

<p>For Ionic Antæ a few words will suffice. Without exactly agreeing with
that of the column, the base does not differ very materially from it,
except, indeed, in the Ilissus example, where it is lower than the
other, and consists only of a shallow scotia with a channeled torus
above it. In the Erechtheum example it is distinguished from the
column base chiefly by both lower and upper torus being channeled. The
capital, or, as it is more commonly termed, <i>anta-cap</i>, on the
contrary, is differently shaped from that of the column, in consequence
of having no volutes; wherefore it is not by any means so wide, neither
is it so deep. The mouldings, too, though of the same character, are
differently disposed. Still the anta-cap corresponds with the capital
as to plainness or enrichment,—being either carved or not, as those of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the latter happen to be; and if the capital has an ornamented necking,
so also has the anta. One singularity in the treatment of Ionic antæ,
is that of the face of the anta, a slight break being made down
the middle of it, which causes it to appear composed of two very
narrow faces put together side by side, but not exactly <i>flush</i>
with each other. This kind of antæ, in imitation of those of the
Erechtheum—perhaps the only precedent for it—has been adopted for
St. Pancras’ Church. What could have led to it is rather difficult to
conjecture, since there does not appear to be any adequate motive for
it, or any purpose gained by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ionic Entablature.</span>—As expressed in the terms of the
diameter of the column, that is, measured by it, the entablature exceeds that of
the Doric Order. In the Parthenon the entire height of the entablature
is not more than 2 diameters; while in both the Ionic and Erechtheum
it is 2 diameters and 17 parts, or the third of a diameter more;
whereas it would seem that the Ionic column being much slenderer, the
entablature ought to be less than 2 diameters in height, instead of
being more. And so it is, and less in a considerable degree: it is the
height, not the diameter, of the column which regulates the height
of the entablature; in other words, the height of the latter must
be in proportion to that of the former.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Now 2⅓ diameters for the entablature is much less in proportion to a
column 8 or 9 diameters high, than 2 diameters for the entablature
is to one that is only 6 diameters high. In the latter case the
entablature is equal to one-third of the column, and one-fourth of the
whole Order; but in the other, 2⅓ diameters amount to only a fourth,
or thereabouts, of the height of the column, and consequently to only
about a fifth of the entire Order.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The Ionic <i>architrave</i> does not differ materially from that of
the Doric. Its average or standard height is the upper diameter of the
column. In the plainer examples of Ionic, such as the Ilissus one, the
face of the architrave is quite plain, as in the preceding Order, and
distinguished from it only by the Doric tenia being converted into a
moulding of a plain bead and small echinus, surmounted by a narrow
tenia or broad fillet. In more decorated examples, as that of the
Erechtheum, the face of the architrave is divided into three surfaces
or courses, called <i>faciæ</i>, which very slightly project before or
overhang each other, and the moulding between the architrave and frieze
is increased in depth; there is a greater number of mouldings, and some
of them are enriched by being carved, or, as it is termed, <i>cut</i>.</p>

<p>As to the Ionic frieze, triglyphs being discarded for it, and no
other characteristic members substituted for them, it becomes no more
than a plain surface interposed between the architrave and cornice,
unless,—as is now never done, although it was, in all probability,
generally done by the Ancients,—it is enriched with figures in
bas-relief or other sculpture. Yet as <i>mere</i> sculpture of that
kind, however essential to effect, is not taken into account, or
considered to belong even to the character of an Order, but to be
something quite extraneous that may either be introduced or omitted at
pleasure, it is omitted accordingly; whereby the frieze is reduced to a
mere blank surface, which leaves nothing more to be said concerning it.</p>

<p>The Ionic cornice affords but little scope for further observation,
more particularly in the Athenian examples, in which it consists of
little more than the <i>corona</i> and cymatium above it, and some
narrow <i>bed-mouldings</i> beneath the former member, partly got out
of its hollowed soffit or under surface. Consequently the whole cornice
looks rather meagre and poor, especially if the richer form of capital
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
with a necking to it be employed for the columns. In such case there
is no corresponding degree of richness and increased importance in
what is, nevertheless, the completing member or division of the
entire Order, and ought accordingly to be treated as such. On this
account we hold the cornice of the Erechtheum example to be very
unsatisfactory, and to derogate from what is the character of the
Order in all other respects: while the capital is particularly ornate,
luxuriant, and complicated in design, the cornice, which, as has been
before remarked, is to be considered as the capital of the entire
Order, is particularly simple and severe; and owing to the want of a
sufficiency of bed-mouldings beneath it, the corona appears to jut out
too abruptly immediately over the frieze, without due preparation for
it. Were the frieze sculptured, such enrichment would, perhaps, without
any thing further, confer an adequate degree of ornateness upon the
whole entablature, and bring it into keeping with the highly finished
columns. If, on the contrary, the frieze is to be left plain, the best
way would be to reduce its height a little, and perhaps that of the
architrave also, and enlarge the cornice by introducing <i>dentels</i>
into it. These last-mentioned members,—which, although considered by
modern writers to be characteristic of the Ionic Order, and to be to
its cornice what <i>mutules</i> are to the Doric, and <i>modillions</i>
to the Corinthian, do not appear to have been so regarded by the Greeks
themselves,—consist of a series of narrow upright blocks (supposed to
represent the ends of joists), placed closely together, so that the
spaces between them, which are only about half as wide as the blocks
themselves, appear to <i>indent</i> that portion of the cornice,
which, when introduced without being so ornamented, is called an uncut
<i>dentel band</i>.</p>

<p>The Priene example, to which we referred when speaking of Ionic
bases, offers what, in our opinion at least, is a far better model
for an Ionic cornice than that of the Erechtheum, and which, with
perhaps some modification of it, might very well be applied to the
more florid Athenian Order; and though to do so would be contrary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
<i>precedent</i>, that would matter little, so that the change itself
were in conformity with artistic effect and æsthetic principles.</p>

<p>The Temple of Jupiter at Aizani in Asia Minor exhibits a remarkable
example of the Ionic Order, the details of which were recently
published, for the first time, by M. Texier. In its general
conformation the base resembles the Priene example; but the entablature
is quite different. The architrave is divided into three faciæ,
separated by a cut moulding; and the upper faciæ is surmounted by an
exceedingly deep and highly enriched course of mouldings. The frieze,
too, is ornamented in a very unusual fashion, acanthus leaves being
placed upon it at intervals, somewhat after the manner of triglyphs,
and connected together with scrolls. The cornice has both dentels and
modillions and a narrow corona, but a deep cymatium or epitithedas,
enriched with carving.</p>

<p>We will not pursue our notice of the Greek or Ancient Ionic any
farther, but here conclude it with observing, that notwithstanding its
decided superiority to the Roman, &amp;c., especially in its capital, the
former has not been adopted by the Italian and French Architects of the
present day. In this country, on the contrary, the Greek Ionic has been
employed almost to the entire exclusion of the other, from the time
of its being first made known to us by means of Stuart and Revett’s
‘Antiquities of Athens,’ and the ‘Ionian Antiquities;’ to which
publications may be added the ‘Unedited Antiquities of Attica,’ which
contains other specimens of the Order, found at Eleusis, remarkable for
their refined simplicity and also their gracefulness. Not the least
important lesson to be derived from these and similar publications is,
we permit ourselves to say, the learning from them that the Greeks
treated their Orders with artistic spirit and freedom, conforming to a
certain type or general standard for each, but varying their details
and modifying their proportions.</p>

<p>For examples of Grecian Doric and Ionic which may be seen in London,
and which the student would therefore do well to look at and carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
examine for himself, since he will from these learn more than he
possibly can do from books alone, we refer to the following buildings:
for Doric, the <i>tetrastyle</i> portico of Covent Garden Theatre, and
the <i>hexastyle</i> one of the Colosseum in the Regent’s Park; which
latter shows the Order to much greater advantage than the other, owing
to its being free from such disturbing and very un-antique additions
as several doors and windows within it, which inevitably destroy all
breadth and repose;—it has also the advantage of a west aspect,
by which the full effect of light and shade is produced. For Ionic
examples, we refer to St. Pancras’ Church, New Road, whose order is a
faithful transcript from that of the Erechtheum; the same building also
affords an instance of the application of a caryatid order of female
figures in the porch, or rather the porch-like structure, on its north
and south sides,—the idea of which is taken from a similar small
structure attached to the Athenian Temple;—the University Club House,
Pall Mall East, where the same Order is applied upon a much smaller
scale, and raised upon a basement floor;—the Chapel in South Audley
Street;—the portico of the Post Office, and the façade of the British
Museum;—the portico of the College of Surgeons, Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
whose columns, proportioned according to the Ilissus example, were
originally plain, but were fluted, and the mouldings of the entablature
cut, when the building was altered and greatly improved some years ago,
by Mr. Barry;—the portico of Hanover Chapel, Regent Street, which, as
the reader is already aware, shows the Priene Ionic;—and lastly, for
we will not further extend this list, the portico of the India House,
Leadenhall Street, which is remarkable for its frieze being sculptured,
and its pediment also filled in with figures in relief. Of similar
decoration for the Doric Order we cannot point out any instance here,
both the metopes of the frieze, and the pediment, being left plain in
all our English specimens of that Order.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROMAN">ROMAN AND MODERN IONIC.</h2>

<p>To elucidate this part of our subject at all satisfactorily would
require a great number of drawings; accordingly we must make shift
as well as we can without them, leaving the student to turn to other
works for examples,—should he, as we trust he will, have imbibed
from our remarks any relish for the study of the Orders by accurate
comparison of various examples of one and the same Order. Neither
the Romans nor their modern successors appear to have comprehended
the genius of the Ionic Order any more than of the Doric. Their best
imitations, both of the one and the other, were of but a bungling
kind. They certainly had no great affection for either, for we find
comparatively very few instances of them in Roman remains. As treated
by them, the Ionic capital was not only greatly impoverished, but
deformed also,—impoverished by the volutes being greatly reduced in
size, and consequently in importance also, as characteristic marks of
the Order,—and deformed, owing to the tasteless treatment of it in
other respects. Instead of the gracefully flowing <i>festoon</i> hem,
or mouldings over the echinus, which seems to connect the two volutes
or sides of the face of the capital together, there is a straight line
without any moulding to it, and the echinus, projecting before it,
produces an appearance of clumsiness—of the several members not being
properly adjusted to each other. As in all the Greek examples, the
echinus of the capital, which passes behind the volutes, is invariably
carved with that sort of pattern which workmen call ‘eggs and darts,’
<i>ova</i> or egg-shaped ornaments, almost naturally resulting from the
contour of the moulding before it is cut; and the echinus of the Ionic,
being always so carved, is on that account distinguished by the name of
<i>ovolo</i>,—not because its section or profile is any portion of an
oval or elliptic curve; for among other things the Roman style differs
from the Greek in having all its moulding, both convex and concave,
formed of portions of circles, by which its details become less elegant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
in contour. But we cannot enter into such niceties in a mere
rudimentary work. Even in the best Roman and modern examples, the
volutes are decidedly inferior to Greek, being comparatively tame
and meagre, yet coarse also. Italian Architects have sometimes made
them so small and insignificant that they give scarcely any character
to the capital, or render it distinguishable, at a little distance,
from the Doric, its general mass being no greater. The spiral makes
fewer revolutions, and the <i>hem</i> or moulding which forms it is
flat, as is also the inter-spiral or general surface of the volute,
which has never any secondary spirals upon it, though that and the
<i>intervolute</i> are sometimes enriched with foliage.</p>

<p>Of the Roman Ionic Order, as a whole, we know very little, there being
only three accredited examples of it, viz. the Theatre of Marcellus,
the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, and the Temple of Concord. Of the first
of these, the capital is the simplest and plainest, and also the
smallest in its proportions; that of the second is by very far the
best, its volutes retaining most of the Greek character; and that of
the third is remarkable, if not for its ugliness in other respects, for
its volutes being turned outwards diagonally, so as to present four
equal faces,—a mode afterwards <i>re-invented</i> and brought up as a
novelty by Scamozzi, in honour of whom it has since been distinguished
by the name of the Scamozzi capital. But if there are few ancient
buildings remaining of the Roman Ionic Order, there are numerous
detached specimens of it in antique columns that have been preserved by
having been made use of in other buildings, or deposited in collections
of sculpture. Many of these have been delineated and published by
Piranesi and others; and they are so numerous and so varied that we
cannot pretend either to classify them, or to particularize even the
principal ones. All that we can here say is, that although they fall
far short of the refined taste exhibited in Greek examples, some of
them possess considerable merit, and supply ideas for other and better
varieties. They also serve to convince us that, like the Greeks, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Romans did not abide by a single stereotype pattern for each Order:
the attempt to establish such uniformity and conformity to rule was
reserved for the Palladios and Vignolas of the 16th century.</p>

<p>There is a fine antique example of the kind in the British Museum, in
which the volutes are placed diagonally, and beneath each face of the
capital there is not a mere flat mask, but a head, cut out in bold
relief, all of them different from each other. The whole is excellently
well composed, and highly interesting as a study. One of the varieties
of Ionic capitals shown by Piranesi is that from a column in the Church
of Santa Maria Transtevere at Rome, which is ornamented on its face
with a small head or bust upon the face of the intervolute and abacus,
and the eye of the volutes themselves is unusually large, and contains
a small half-length female figure carved upon it,—which, though it
can be distinctly seen in a drawing, can be hardly perceptible in
the column itself. The only other variety of or <i>invention</i> for
the Ionic capital that we can notice is one that has frequently been
practised by Italian Architects, and which may be distinguished as
the <i>festoon</i> or festooned capital, the volutes being turned
diagonally, and a festoon being suspended from the eye one volute
to that of the other beneath each face. This not only gives variety
and richness to the capital, but by increasing its volume or bulk,
increases its importance also, and produces great play of light and
shade: there is harmony together with diversity in the combination of
forms, the curve of the festoon being, though dissimilar, in agreement
with the outline of the volutes. The columns of the circular portico
to the Church in Langham Place have capitals of this description, in
which cherub heads are introduced into the festoons; and so far as the
mere capitals go, that specimen of Ionic is entitled to much praise:
the misfortune is, that the Order is not satisfactory as a whole; for
the increased richness of the capitals requires that there should be a
corresponding degree of richness given to the entablature. At present
there is no proportion—that is, with regard to decoration—observed;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
for the same entablature, or cornice at least, which is in keeping
with a smaller and plainer capital, cannot be equally adapted to a
larger and more ornate one, but partakes of either excess, or the ‘too
much’ in the one case, or of deficiency, or the ‘too little’ in the
other,—not perhaps as to size, but in regard to the <i>quantum</i>
of embellishment. To obviate the meagreness and insignificance of the
usual Italian Ionic capital, Sansovino and some others have frequently
given it a necking, either plain or enriched, which, even when plain,
greatly improves the general appearance of the column by increasing
the depth of the capital and reducing the height of the shaft. To make
this the clearer, let us, without pretending at all to exactness, call
the column nine diameters high, and the capital either half a diameter,
or a whole one, accordingly as it is without or with a necking: now
in the first case the capital will be to the shaft (base included)
only as one to <i>seventeen</i>, whereas in the other it becomes as
one to <i>eight</i>; which is not at all too much, while the other way
the shaft is much too lanky, and the capital too low,—as is probably
felt by those who cannot explain the cause of such disagreement and
disproportion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Entablature.</span>—There is not much to say, at least
there is no occasion for saying much, relative to this part of the Roman and
Modern Ionic Order. The ancient examples of it are by far too few to
admit of any general laws for it being derived from them; nor are the
examples themselves very satisfactory. That of the Ionic of the Theatre
of Marcellus is, perhaps, the best upon the whole, and seems to have
been that which has guided the Moderns in the composition of their
entablature, although they have very greatly diminished the proportions
of the cornice, which is there nearly equal to both architrave and
frieze together. In the Athenian Ionic we may set down the architrave,
frieze, and cornice as about 50, 50, and 35 minutes respectively,
making altogether two diameters and 15 minutes (or a quarter of a
diameter); therefore the cornice is to each of the other two divisions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
of the entablature only as 35 to 50. In the Roman Ionic, on the
contrary, the cornice is by much the largest division: in the Fortuna
Virilis example the measures are,—architrave 38', frieze 19', cornice
70'; in that of the Theatre of Marcellus, 43'—36'—66', making the
entire entablature 127', or 2 diameters 7'. Although modern Architects
vary from these proportions, and some of them make the frieze equal
to or more than the architrave, they all agree—in doctrine at least,
if not in practice—in making the cornice the largest division of the
entablature; and as the projection is usually equal to its height,
or thereabouts, the cornice thus gains in importance both ways, and,
as far as its mere proportions are concerned, becomes an adequate
finishing to the entire Order. This latter mode certainly appears
more in accordance with artistic principle: shall we then presume
to say that the Greeks were wrong in their treatment of the Ionic
cornice?—Well, let us say then, that they were not quite so right as
they might have been. To us, the Asiatic Ionic cornice (for instance
that of the Priene Order) is far more satisfactory than either the
Hellenic or Athenian; and in our opinion it would require a cornice
richer still, to correspond with the highly elaborated Erechtheum
capital, and maintain due artistic keeping in the whole of that Order.
These remarks partake, perhaps, too much of digression: we will
therefore dismiss them, and the cornice also, merely adding that either
dentels, or larger plain blocks, placed rather wide apart from each
other, are considered the proper characteristic marks of the Ionic cornice.</p>

<p>There is nothing in either the architrave or the frieze that calls for
observation, except that the Moderns have frequently given to this
Order, by way of distinction, a convex frieze, technically termed
a <i>pulvinated</i> one from its fancied resemblance to a cushion
(<i>pulvinar</i>), whose sides swell out by compression when sat
upon. A frieze of the kind occurs in what is otherwise a very corrupt
specimen of the Order, in the Baths of Diocletian. It would be absurd
to suppose that such form of frieze originated in an imitation of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
thing after which it is now named; and there are two motives, either
of which, or both combined, may have led to it. The first of them is,
that such curvature in the face of the frieze may have been thought
very suitable for the Ionic Order, as agreeing with the curved forms
predominating in the character of the capital, namely, the volutes.
The second is, that a convex surface produces greater diversity of
light and shade than a plain one; and coming between the architrave
and cornice, is sufficiently distinguished by contour alone. Still it
must be admitted that such form is somewhat too arbitrary and fanciful
to be in accordance with strict architectural principles. It is well
enough suited for interiors, or for entablatures upon a small scale,
such as those of doors and windows, but not for a large external
Order. The pulvinated frieze occurs frequently in the Cinque-cento and
Renaissance styles, and in our own English Renaissance, or Elizabethan.
An instance of it may be seen in that well-known and celebrated piece
of architecture by Jones, the front of Whitehall Chapel, whose Ionic
Order generally will convey an idea of the Italian mode of treating it.
And it so happens that the tasteful little screen front of Dover House
(added by Holland to the original mansion), on the opposite side of
the street, offers an example of the Ilissus Ionic, whereby immediate
comparison between the two styles may easily be made. Another specimen
of Italian Ionic, and of Italian Doric, is the new portion lately
added to the Carlton Club House, Pall Mall, which is all but a literal
copy from Sansovino’s Library of St. Mark at Venice. Sansovino seems
there to have aimed at the greatest possible richness for both Orders;
and in his building the Doric metopes are sculptured, but are left
plain in the Club House, although such decoration for them would have
been novelty here, and would have brought that lower Order more into
keeping with the upper one. The shafts of the columns are not fluted
as in the Italian building, but for very sufficient reason: being of
dark polished granite, they would have acquired no great richness in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
consequence of their being so cut; on the contrary, the effect of
the material itself would have been impaired. The Ionic capitals
have an ornamented necking, which is here not only a beauty but a
great propriety, because without it the capitals would have looked
diminutive, more especially beneath such a greatly exaggerated
entablature. Tested by ordinary rules, this last must be pronounced
monstrous, licentious in the extreme, perhaps downright barbarous; and,
no doubt, would be so, were it not protected by the name of Sansovino.
His English copyist has therefore sufficient authority for it,—not so,
Sansovino himself: whence, then, did he get his <i>precedent</i>? Well,
he dispensed with precedent, and using the privilege of a Master in his
Art, ventured beyond its written rules and conventionalities,—ventured
where he might have failed, and exposed himself to derision,—but
succeeded, and has been crowned by applause. In Art, as in other
things, success sanctifies enterprize: if you fail, the world calls
you a madman or fool; if you succeed, it bows down to you as a genius.
It must be confessed that such an entablature as Sansovino has there
given his Ionic Order would be nothing less than monstrous, did the
Order itself constitute the edifice, as in the antique temple; instead
of which, the two Orders there introduced are no more than ornamental
accessories, and the greatly enlarged entablature of the upper one is
to be regarded as proportioned with reference not so much to its own
columns as to the general mass of the entire façade. It may be as well
to remark here, that both the Carlton Club House and Whitehall Chapel
are instances of <i>super-columniation</i>, or two Orders placed one
over the other—in the former building, an Ionic over a Doric—in the
latter, a Corinthian over an Ionic Order. And in both cases the columns
are <i>attached</i> or <i>engaged</i>, as is said of columns which
are united to the face of a wall so as not to project from it as much
as their diameter, but only about half or three-quarters of it, and
are therefore termed respectively <i>half</i> or <i>three-quarter</i> columns.

    <img src="images/image053.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="613" />
</div>

<p>We now arrive at the third and last of the Orders, or that which is
distinguished from the other two, more by its deep and foliaged capital
than by its proportions,—at least it is chiefly so distinguished from
the Ionic, with which it has in other respects many points in common;
for the columns of both have bases differing but little from each
other, and their shafts are fluted in the same manner. How this Order
came to obtain the name of Corinthian is not very clear; nor is it,
architecturally, of any moment whether such name be right or wrong. All
that is certain is, that examples of this Order have not been found at
Corinth itself, where, judging from its name, it would seem to have
been the prevalent style of building, and there brought to perfection.
There is a pretty legend relative to the origin of the Corinthian
capital, which, if not true, has at least probability in its favour,
and is many degrees less nonsensical than the supposed origin of the
Ionic one. Nay, it is even valuable and instructive, as showing how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
well a skilful artist can derive hints from trivial or accidental
circumstances, and by improving upon them, turn them to account.
As the story goes, the sculptor Callicrates was so struck by the
graceful forms into which the leaves of an acanthus plant had grown
up around a tall basket covered by a square slab, that he sketched
it, and conceived the idea of fashioning the capital of a column
after it. It must be owned that the anecdote seems itself to be an
invention intended to account poetically for the origin of such form
of capital, and perhaps on no better grounds than that of a fancied
general resemblance,—just as some dreamers have detected the origin of
the Gothic style in an avenue of lofty over-arching trees, or in the
interlacing stems of a framing of wicker-work. Unluckily for the credit
of so respectable a legend, the earliest examples exhibit, instead of
the strongest and most direct resemblance to the presumed prototype,
the faintest and most vague of all. The Corinthian capital seems rather
to have developed itself gradually out of the Doric one; first, by its
necking being deepened and ornamented with a row of leaves, and then
afterwards the echinus suppressed, and the whole body of the capital
made to expand in a concave curve up to the abacus, with a second row
of plain and flatter leaves above the first one. At least the capitals
to the small columns of the porches of the Tower of the Winds at
Athens, and others discovered at Miletus and elsewhere, seem to favour
such hypothesis; and in further evidence of such Doric derivation
is the circumstance of the columns of the Tower of the Winds being
without bases. It will be argued, perhaps, that such examples do not
all answer to the character afterwards established and adhered to for
capitals belonging to that Order. Very true: but then they may surely
be received as incipient efforts and attempts towards the formation
of a third class of capitals; and in the instances just referred to,
the overhanging square abacus without any foliage or curling tendrils
spreading out to support its extremities, points, in our opinion,
clearly enough to a derivation from the Doric capital, considerably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
enlarged downwards, and also greatly enriched. However, we leave others
either to adopt or reject this notion, just as they may be disposed.
At the best, all such questions are little better than matters of idle
curiosity, and must always remain questions after all.</p>

<p>To quit conjecture for fact, the fact is the Corinthian Order does
not appear to have been ever matured into a distinct style and
complete system by the Greeks. There is, indeed, one solitary Athenian
example of Corinthian, which exhibits the utmost refinement of
exquisite richness attempered by exquisite delicacy. In the Lysicrates
capital,—as we will for convenience call it (the example alluded to
being that of the monument of Lysicrates, otherwise called the Lantern
of Demosthenes, at Athens),—foliation may be said to have attained
its culminating point: rivalled it may be, but hardly surpassed. Still
it must be confessed, as a whole, that Order leaves much to be desired
for it, there being nothing of corresponding beauty and luxuriance in
the rest of it. The cornice, for instance, is only a simple dentelled
Ionic one, nor are any of the mouldings of the entablature cut. There
was, however, in that particular case, above the entablature, what
fully counterbalances and carries out the idea and expression of the
capitals, namely, the ornamental roofing, and the matchless finial
which crowns the structure, and produces a full climax of beauty and of
grace. Charming as the original itself is, or, more correctly speaking,
<i>was</i>, it has perhaps been more blunderingly copied and imitated
than almost any other antique structure. Although the whole—its
lofty-proportioned basement included—is not above 36 feet high, a copy
of it, or what calls itself such, has sometimes been hoisted up on the
top of a lofty tower, or raised on a modern church or chapel to serve
as its belfry; or else the columns and entablature have been taken just
verbatim, and applied, by way of change, as an Order, upon a scale for
which the capitals, at least, were never intended. The Strand front or
entrance of Exeter Hall consists of a loggia with lofty columns of the
kind, whose capitals, being placed at such a height, show as no better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
than heavy sculptured masses whose details it is impossible, or at
least requires great patience, to make out. More preposterously still,
the Girard College at Philadelphia plumes itself upon exhibiting an
exact copy of this Order, where the columns are magnified to the height
of between fifty and sixty feet, so that all that can be made out of
the capital is, that it is exceedingly rich,—by very far too much so
for any other part or feature in the building;—and that is called
being classical!</p>

<p>Let us now consider the Corinthian Order in its general and prominent
characteristics, belonging to all varieties of it alike. Although
the Order itself is the most delicate and lightest of the three,
the capital is the largest, being considerably more than a diameter
in height,—upon the average, about a diameter and a quarter. This,
however, will cause the reader no surprise, if he bears in mind what
has been before said as to the proportion to be observed between the
column and its capital. The taller the former is, the taller must
be the latter also, and so far bulkier; although, while actually
increasing its bulk, its tallness corrects the appearance of heaviness
by giving the <i>proportion</i> of slenderness. A capital whose height
is only half a diameter is, of course, by no means positively so bulky
as one which is upwards of an entire diameter in height, but then it is
much bulkier or broader in its proportions, being about twice as broad
as it is high,—whereas the other is much higher than it is wide. This
explanation makes, we hope, the matter sufficiently clear, and that
after it the reader will not feel himself at all puzzled about it.</p>

<p>The capital has two rows of leaves, eight in each row, so disposed that
of the taller ones composing the upper row, one comes in the middle,
beneath each face of the abacus, and the lower leaves <i>alternate</i>
with the upper ones, coming between the stems of the latter; so that in
the first or lower tier of leaves there is in the middle of each face a
space between two leaves occupied by the stem of the central leaf above
them. Over these two rows is a third series of four leaves, turned so as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to support the small volutes which, in turn, support the angles of
the abacus. Besides these outer volutes, which are invariably turned
diagonally, as in the four-faced Ionic capital, there are two other
smaller ones, termed <i>caulicoli</i>, which meet each other beneath
a flower on the face of the abacus. The abacus itself is differently
shaped from what it is in either of the other two Orders. In the Doric
it is, as we have seen, merely a thick square slab, fitting the echinus
beneath it, and left perfectly plain. In the Ionic it is square, but
its sides are moulded, whether they are carved or not. The Corinthian
abacus, on the contrary, is not, properly speaking, a square, although
it may be said to be so in its general form, inasmuch as it possesses
<i>squareness</i>, having four equal sides. Instead of being straight,
the sides of the abacus are concave in plan, being curved outwards so
as to produce a sharp point at each corner, which is accordingly cut
off. Thus we find that the abacus here assumes a very different shape
from its original one; yet merely to know this is to know very little.
Such form of it is of course a distinction, but it was not for the
sake of distinction that it was adopted. It grew out of intention and
purpose: it was dictated by necessity—by artistic necessity at least,
which requires that the abacus should be adjusted to and conform to the
upper part of the capital, so that they fit each other. Now a square
abacus would not at all suit a capital whose foliage spreads out so
widely at its angles. We have spoken of the capitals of the Tower of
the Winds, as, according to our opinion, showing the earliest formation
of what we now call the Corinthian capital. In that example the
abacus is square, and the upper row of leaves are of the kind called
<i>water-leaves</i>, from their resemblance to those of water-plants,
being broad and flat, and merely carved upon the <i>vase</i> or body of
the capital. The next stage of progress or transition was to add larger
curling leaves and volutes to support the angles of the abacus; but
then if the abacus remained square as before, it would either overhang
the capital too much in the centre of each face of it, or would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
cover the enlarged sweep of the leaves and volutes at the angles.
Consequently, it was necessary to effect both extension and reduction
for the abacus,—extension at its angles, and reduction as regards
its general bulk, which beforehand apparently very difficult, if not
impossible feat, was accomplished in the simplest manner possible, by
merely curving the sides of the abacus. Thus not only is the abacus
expressly shaped in conformity with the great projection of the leaves,
&amp;c., at the four angles of the capital,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
but a beautiful contrast, contributing to general harmony, ensues
in consequence,—the concave sides of the abacus corresponding
antithetically—in other words, contrasting with the general convexity
of the capital.</p>

<p>The general structure and configuration of the Corinthian capital are
now described, and, it is to be hoped, understood also. It may be
as well, however, just to recapitulate: the body of the capital is
surrounded by two rows of leaves, eight in each row; besides which
there are four leaves, which, with the volutes over them, serve to
support the four angles of the abacus, which is fashioned as we have
just been explaining. Simple and limited as these elementary and
<i>constitutional</i> forms may be thought to be,—insufficient for
any great variety or range of character, the Corinthian capital admits
of almost infinite modification. Putting entirely aside all details
and their minutiæ, the capital of this Order is susceptible of very
great diversity of character in regard to its general proportions
alone, as may be seen by a comparison of a few—and they but a very
<i>few</i>—examples given in a note below.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Almost every antique example is marked by something peculiar to itself;
wherefore, properly to analyze them and compare them all, would require
not only some scores, but some hundreds of drawings, and hundreds
might be multiplied into thousands, were we to collect together all
the varieties of the descendants of the Corinthian or foliaged-capital
column that are to be found in buildings of the so-called Byzantine
style, when the original idea of an Order had been entirely lost sight
of. In fact, all the compositions that have been produced with the
intention of producing a <i>new</i>, and what as such ought to be a
perfectly distinct Order, congruent in all its parts, have consisted of
little more than variations of the Corinthian capital; as if difference
in the details of the capital sufficed to constitute a different and
quite distinct Order. Properly understood, <i>Order</i> is, if not
exactly so, little more than another word for style; and a new style is
not to be invented or established, like the alteration from old to new
style of the almanac by Act of Parliament. Style must of necessity grow
up gradually: the ideas of many minds must contribute to its formation.</p>

<p>From the examples whose proportions are stated in the preceding note,
it will be seen that the height of the capital varies from 60', or just
a diameter, to 87', or nearly half as much again; although it must be
allowed that the latter is a very unusual degree of height, nor does
that example (the Lysicrates one) belong, like the others, to the Roman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Corinthian class. Reserving our remarks on one or two particular
specimens of the latter till after we have spoken generally of the
other parts of the Order, we continue by saying that the proper
Corinthian base differs from that of the usual Ionic or Attic in having
two smaller scotiæ, separated by two astragals: however, both kinds are
employed indiscriminately, and the Attic is that which is generally
used, except a greater degree of delicacy and richness than ordinary be
required. As the shaft is fluted similarly to that of the Ionic column,
viz. with twenty-four channels, there is nothing for notice or remark
there, unless it be that the flutes are sometimes <i>cabled</i>, as
it is called, that is, the channels are hollowed out for only about
two-thirds of the upper part of the shaft, and the remainder cut so
that each channel has the appearance of being partly filled up by a
round staff or piece of rope, whence the term <i>cabling</i>. Though
not approved by puritan critics,—who, nevertheless, wink at, or else
are blind to much greater licenses,—this mode of fluting certainly
gives an expression of greater strength to the lower part of the
column, and, by contrast, that of greater delicacy to the upper one.
Although fluting, for the columns, seems to have been considered by the
Ancients essential to the character of this Order, the Moderns appear
to consider it quite a matter of indifference, and what may be omitted
<i>at discretion</i>. Undoubtedly there are several antique examples
exceedingly richly decorated in all other respects, yet with the shafts
of the columns unfluted; but then that was for very good reason,
the shafts being either of polished granite, or precious marble,
whose intrinsic value and beauty fully supplied the place of further
embellishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Entablature.</span>—The architrave is generally divided
into three faciæ, (the lower one much narrower than the others, which is rather
contrary to architectonic principle, the weaker member being placed
under heavier ones,) with mouldings between them, which, though
frequently left plain, are properly enriched in the best and most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
consistently finished-up examples. We pass over the frieze, that being
merely a single surface, either plain or sculptured. The cornice is
very much larger than in the other Orders,—larger as to height,
and consequently as to projection also; which increased height and
projection, and we may add, increased richness, are demanded by the
greatly enlarged bulk of the capital and its more elaborate decoration.
Examples vary so greatly that we can give only approximating mean and
average proportions, which may be set down at about 2 diam. 12' for the
whole entablature, and 54', or something less than a diameter, for the
cornice; but it is in many instances more, in others as much less. As
may be supposed from this greatly increased depth of the cornice, it
consists of a greater number of mouldings beneath the corona, for that
and the cymatium over it invariably retain their places as the crowning
members of the whole series of mouldings. To the dentels of the Ionic
cornice is added a row of <i>modillions</i>, immediately beneath and
supporting the corona. These modillions are ornamental blocks, curved
in their under surface somewhat after the manner of the letter S turned
thus [symbol]; and between them and the dentels, and also below the
latter, are other mouldings, sometimes cut, at others left plain.
Sometimes a plain uncut <i>dentel band</i> is substituted for dentels;
sometimes, in simpler cornices, that is omitted altogether, and plainer
blocks are employed instead of modillions; or else both dentels and
modillions are omitted, as in the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina,
notwithstanding that it is considerably enriched, even the face of the
corona being fluted.</p>

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/image062.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="636" />
</div>

<p>Besides the several varieties of the Corinthian shown in the whole
composition of the Order, or the columns and entablature together,
there are numerous fragmentary examples existing, either in single
columns or capitals alone, or in cornices and other parts of
entablatures; some of which display such prodigality of decoration and
such difference of character from the usual Corinthian, that they might
very well pass for belonging to a distinct Order, if that variety which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
is classed as a separate one, under the name of <span class="smcap">Composite</span>,
can with any propriety be reckoned such, merely because the volutes at the
angles of the capital are expanded into the proportions of those in the
Roman Ionic capital.</p>

<p>The very dissimilar varieties to be met with, all belonging to one
and the same Order, show plainly enough that the Architects of
antiquity considered themselves at liberty to design their own detail,
and to treat an Order as a composition marked out for them in its
leading forms and general proportions, but which they might fashion
nearly <i>ad libitum</i> in other respects. Modern Architects adopt
a contrary course, which, if not particularly artistic, or even
rational, is certainly convenient; although in spite of all precaution
to secure conformity and maintain architectural orthodoxy, grievous
licentiousness will creep in. It is something to get what is only a
faithful copy of an ancient example, but it is only very rarely we get
even that. For instance, fluting is omitted for the columns where such
decoration may be required, in order to make them correspond with the
degree of richness given to the entablature; or else it is the latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
with which wholesale liberty is taken,—mouldings which in the cornice
of the original are more or less enriched, being left plain, or a bare
frieze substituted for a sculptured one, and other little liberties
of that kind, which are considered perfectly allowable, and to make
hardly any real difference, although they in fact alter the character
of the whole composition. Either the original is itself faulty, or it
must suffer by <i>piecemeal</i> alteration. It will, perhaps, bear
to be somewhat reduced in richness, or, <i>vice versâ</i>, to have
a greater degree of decoration given it; but in whichever way such
kind of alteration takes place, it should be conducted uniformly for
the whole composition. No excellence of proportions can atone for
<i>disproportion</i> in regard to consistency of embellishment, and for
the general disharmony of the whole composition. Italian Architects not
unfrequently either overload their compositions with ornament, or leave
them quite bare, and make no scruple of putting a cornice of the most
meagre description, without either dentels or modillions, to an Order
whose capitals denote it to be intended for Ionic or Corinthian.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, fortunate both for Sir John Soane, and that example
of the Corinthian which he employed for the Bank of England, that it
was not an invention of his own, or it would, in all probability, have
been ridiculed as a monstrosity; and he would have been thought to
have there out-Soaned himself in whimsicality and capriciousness. As
it happens to be, however, an express copy from the circular Temple
at Tivoli, people are at liberty to admire it, more especially as the
mere application of it for the first time in this country—the only one
where it has been adopted—does not exalt Soane into the successful
inventor of a ‘new Order.’ In the system of the Orders it may certainly
be regarded as a newly-discovered planet, being so distinct from every
other example of the foliaged-capital class; distinct not only in the
capital itself, but in all its members, in all its proportions, in the
style of all its details, and, consequently, in its character. The
height of the column is only 9·25' diameters; the capital, measured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
from above the astragal, only 1 diameter, and the entablature only
1·42' diameter. These proportions give the whole Order a certain
expression of masculine simplicity, more especially as the column
is hardly diminished at all, the difference between the upper and
lower diameter amounting to no more than 4', or only ¹/₁₅th of the
larger diameter, that being of course 60', and the other 56'. The
base consists of two <i>tori</i>, but instead of the usual scotiæ
between, there is merely a narrow plain fillet, and a second broader
one, overhung by the upper torus. Besides which, another peculiarity
is, that the lower torus is somewhat detached from the surface on
which the column stands, by a very narrow but deep incision beneath
it,—a mode of treatment quite different from the usual one of placing
the base upon a square plinth, but which, different as it is, does
not produce, as might be supposed, any appearance of weakness, the
incision being no more than a mere line—a delicate artistic touch.
The fluting (at least the mode in which the flutes are terminated)
is not a little remarkable; for below, they and the fillets are
continued, and die into the upper edge of the base; while above, they
are terminated horizontally instead of by a semicircular curve, as in
all other examples of both Ionic and Corinthian fluting. The capital is
so exceedingly peculiar in conformation and detail as to defy verbal
description. The leaves have nothing in common with those of the usual
acanthus; the volutes are of peculiar shape, and the flower which
ornaments the abacus is as singularly large, and descends to the top of
the upper leaf: boldness and breadth of parts characterize the whole
composition, and also that of the entablature. As all its mouldings
are uncut, this last would be much too plain to be in keeping with the
column, were not the frieze sculptured with rich and ‘bossy’ festoons
in the same energetic style as the capitals. Such ornamentation of the
frieze is absolutely part and parcel of the Order; and the value of it
will be best understood by comparing those parts of the Bank, in which
it is retained, with others in which it is omitted. The same Order,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
with the frieze enriched, has also been since employed in the front of
St. Paul’s School, St. Paul’s Churchyard; but there, owing to windows
and other disturbing circumstances, its effect is greatly impaired, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
is the case even in the centre of the south front of the Bank itself,
where it differs widely from the beautiful loggia at the north-west
angle of that edifice, and compared with which it manifests in the part
first mentioned a sad falling off, becoming no better than a dull,
spiritless, prosaic version of its real self. In a word, it is out of
its element.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/image065.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="699" />
</div>

<p>The next, and it must be the last example which can here be noticed,
is that of the so-called ‘Jupiter Stator,’ which may be said to exhibit
<i>Corinthianism</i> in its fullest luxuriance. Great as is the
dissimilarity between this and the preceding example of the Order, they
are alike in one respect, each being perfect in its way, complete, and
harmonious in all its parts; and we ought to be thankful that two such
opposite specimens of one and the same—namely, the foliaged-capital
style—have been preserved to us for our admiration, and for our
instruction also, as if on purpose to convince us what opposite kinds
of beauty may be arrived at where, though the general configuration of
the Order is adhered to, a different spirit and character are infused
into it. Of the example now referred to, the character is elaborate
richness subdued by refined taste. Though of lower proportions than
usual, the capital is singularly ornate, and a corresponding degree
of ornateness is diffused over the entire Order. The second or middle
facia of the architrave, and all the members of the cornice, except
the dentels and the cymatium over the corona, are sculptured, and the
whole is consistently finished up in every part. The first application
among us of this superb example of the Corinthian was in Holland’s
beautiful portico to Carlton House, where, instead of being moderated,
its richness was even augmented, the bases of the columns being carved,
and the frieze sculptured. That portico has disappeared: the columns,
indeed, still remain, having been used for the portico of the National
Gallery, but the Order itself exists no more—at least not there.
Another copy of it we now have in the Treasury Buildings, Whitehall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
where it was applied by Soane, but with no great judgment or taste,
his building being quite at variance with the Order he selected for
it, the former being any thing but Corinthian in character. Perhaps he
selected it, as we have done, for the purpose of exhibiting in two of
his works such very distinct styles of Corinthian as are the Tivoli and
the Jupiter Stator Orders. As now altered by Mr. Barry, the Treasury
Buildings have received a great accession of richness, and the frieze,
which was before plain, is now ornamented. But the Order itself is
not improved, at least does not show itself to the same advantage as
before, by being raised so much higher above the eye than it was at
first; it looks comparatively diminished, and the beauty of its details
is lost. We have, indeed, the Order; and nothing is wanting but that
impressiveness and effect which gave such charm to the portico of
Carlton House.</p>

<p>As to that variety of the Corinthian which passes under the name of
<i>Composite</i>, the reader may now, after what has been said and
shown, be left to judge whether it can with any propriety be classed
as a distinct Order, instead of being reckoned merely as a variety
of the other, and by no means the most striking variety of that
foliaged-capital class. The difference between the two extends to no
more than a part of the detail of the capital, the general normal
character or Corinthianism of which is no way affected. And if the
Ionic Order be allowed to comprehend many decidedly marked varieties
of the voluted-capital type, there surely can be no necessity for
splitting Doric and Corinthian, and getting out of them the Tuscan and
Composite Orders. It will, perhaps, be fancied by some that by thus
reducing the number of the Orders to three, we in some degree limit the
resources which the Architect derives from them. The fact, however, is
precisely the reverse; for although we limit them in number, we set no
limits to their respective powers. A hundred different examples, each
marked by individual character, or peculiarity of treatment, may yet
all belong to the same generic type or order. Ancient examples are not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
to be considered merely as <i>patterns</i>, to be copied mechanically,
but as studies for the Architect’s guidance and instruction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COLUMN">COLUMNIATION.</h2>

<p>Columns and entablatures in themselves do not, properly speaking,
constitute an Order, although they serve as specimens of it. They must
enter into and regulate the organization of a structure before they
can become by composition what is, strictly speaking, an Order. As
exhibited in their temples, the system of columniation practised by the
Ancients was strictly organic and natural. Instead of being something
accessory, supplementary to, and independent of the fabric, that
might be either omitted or applied at pleasure, as commonly practised
in Italian and modern composition, the Order itself constituted the
exterior of the building, at least of that side or front of it where it
was introduced, when it was not continued throughout; so that the Order
and its dimensions once established, and the mode of intercolumniation
determined, the edifice shaped itself. Before we enter upon the subject
of intercolumniation, it will be desirable to explain the various forms
of temples, and the technical terms by which they are distinguished.</p>

<p>The <i>naos</i>, or <i>cella</i>, as it is more usually called, or
temple itself, was comparatively small, even where the entire mass
was of considerable size, gradual extension of plan being produced
not so much by any great enlargement of the interior as by external
columniation and its gradual development. It is probable that the
earliest Greek temples consisted of the <i>naos</i> only, and were
accordingly plain <span class="allsmcap">ASTYLAR</span> buildings, or without
columns, except in front or at the entrance end, where an enclosed porch was
formed by introducing columns, by continuing the side walls, and
placing columns between them <i>in antis</i>, that is, between the two
<i>antæ</i> or pilasters forming the ends of those walls. The next
step seems to have been to advance the porch before the main building,
instead of keeping it recessed within the side walls, thereby converting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
it from a portico in antis, into a <i>prostyle</i>, or projecting line
of columns: thus a <i>distyle in antis</i>, or a portico consisting of
two columns between antæ, consequently of three <i>intercolumns</i>,
or open spaces between the antæ and columns, would become a
<i>tetrastyle</i>, or projecting portico of four columns and three
intercolumns. By the other end of the building being similarly treated,
the temple became <i>amphiprostyle</i>, or prostyle at both ends, in
rear as well as in front, the sides still remaining <i>astylar</i>. The
next and last style of advancement was to continue columniation all
round, enclosing the <i>cella</i> within colonnades along its sides
as well as at its ends, which disposition of plan is expressed by the
terms <i>peristyle</i>, or <i>peristylar</i>, and <i>peripteral</i>,
which of necessity produces two columns and two intercolumns more in
front; for what would otherwise be merely a tetrastyle prostyle, with
four columns and three intercolumns (the number of the latter being
always one less than that of the others), becomes by the colonnades
being continued along the side, a <i>hexastyle</i> (<i>six</i> columns
and <i>five</i> intercolumns); or if originally a prostyle hexastyle,
it would be rendered an <i>octastyle</i> (<i>eight</i> columns and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
<i>seven</i> intercolumns), and so on.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It should be observed, too, that a building cannot at the same time be
<i>peristylar</i> and have a <i>prostyle</i> portico, the latter being
merged in the general columniation, instead of projecting from the
rest of the edifice as a distinct feature. Of peristylar temples there
were two sorts, viz. those with a single row of columns on each side,
and those which have two, which last are distinguished by the term
<i>dipteral</i>, i. e. having two wings or <i>aisles</i> on each side.
Although it did not at all affect the general external appearance,
notwithstanding that it extended the plan by adding two more columns
and intercolumns to the front, this last-mentioned mode was attended
with greater richness of columniation, and the inner columns
contributed not a little to variety of effect and play of perspective;
besides which, greater sheltered space was gained for ambulatories;
whereas in the usual simple peristyle, where the space between the
outer columns and the walls of the cella was limited to the width of
a single intercolumn, the side colonnades were mere narrow passages,
very little wider—at least in Doric temples—than the diameter of the
columns themselves, consequently of very little actual service. In what
is called the <i>pseudo-dipteral</i> mode, more of clear space within
the colonnades was provided by omitting the inner columns, which mode
reduced the plan to that of a simple peristyle, the only difference
being, that instead of the width of a single intercolumn, a clear
space, equal to two intercolumns and one column, was gained for the
ambulatories. The Temple of Jupiter at Selinus was of this description,
and being only octastyle in front,—the least possible width for a

dipteral or pseudo-dipteral plan,—of the seven front intercolumns, four
(<i>i. e.</i> two on each side) were given to the lateral colonnades, and
only three left for the breadth of the <i>cella</i>, which must have looked
like a smaller edifice standing within a colonnaded and covered enclosure.</p>

<p>The above few and simple arrangements of plan are nearly all the
varieties that the Greek temple style offers; and some of them are
little better than distinctions without differences, inasmuch as the
differences do not affect general external appearance. Peripteral,
dipteral, and pseudo-dipteral, all agree in the main point, and the two
latter answer to the name of peripteral as well as the first, being
merely modifications of it. Great as were its æsthetic beauties, Greek
Architecture was—why should we scruple to confess it?—exceedingly
limited in its compass and power of expression: what it did, it did
admirably, but it confined itself too much to one idea. “When you have
seen one green field,” says Johnson, “you have seen all green fields;”
and so we may say of Greek temples,—when you have seen one or two
of them, you have seen all of them. However they may differ from one
another as to the treatment of the Order adopted for them, the number
of their columns, and mere particulars of that kind, they resemble each
other very nearly in all leading points. Not only were their plans
invariably parallelograms, but alike also as to proportion, forming a
double square, or being about twice as much in length as in breadth;
for so exceedingly <i>methodical</i> was the Greek system, that the
number of columns on the flanks or sides of a peripteral temple was
regulated and determined by the number of those in front. The number
of the columns in front was invariably an even one, as otherwise there
would be no middle intercolumn; but on the flanks of the edifice, where
there was no entrance, the number of the intercolumns was an even, and
that of the columns an uneven one, so that a column came in the centre
of these side elevations.</p>

<p>As to the mode in which the front influenced the sides by determining
the number of columns for them, the established rule seems to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
to give the flanks twice as many intercolumns as there were columns at
each end: thus the Parthenon, which is octastyle, has <i>sixteen</i>
intercolumns, consequently seventeen columns, on each flank. In like
manner, a hexastyle temple would have <i>twelve</i> intercolumns
and thirteen columns on its sides. There are, however, exceptions;
for instance, the temple at Selinus, which has been mentioned as an
example of the pseudo-dipteral mode of columniation, is an octastyle,
with sixteen, or just twice as many columns on its sides as in front;
consequently the intercolumns are only fifteen, and being uneven in
number, there is a middle one, as in the front itself. After all, the
difference caused by there being an intercolumn more or less than usual
is but a very slight one, such as is to be ascertained only by counting
the columns, and such as not to occasion any perceptible difference in
the general physiognomy of the building.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Besides the restriction as to general proportion of plan, namely, the
fixed relationship between the length and the breadth of the building,
proportion with regard to height was limited in a different way, and in
such a manner that the character of increased richness and importance
derived from a greater number of columns was attended, not indeed by
decreased height, but by <i>decreased loftiness</i>, or proportional
height, that is, height as measured by either breadth or length.
Paradoxical as this may sound at first, nothing can be more clear
when once explained. Discarding nicety of measurement, we will call a
<i>tetrastyle</i> portico about a square in height, that is, about as
high as wide; but add four more columns, extend it from a tetrastyle
to an octastyle, so that it becomes about a double square in breadth,
or twice as wide again, and the inevitable consequence is, that it is
then only half as high as wide; that is, as to proportion, only half
as <i>lofty</i> as it was before. The expression of <i>loftiness</i>,
in which altitude greatly predominates over breadth, was quite beyond
the reach of the Greek system. Their temples might be planted on lofty
eminences, but the structures themselves never towered upwards. As far
as it went, their system was perfect,—so complete indeed in itself as
to be unfit for almost any other purposes than that for which it was
expressly framed.</p>

<p>If the Romans corrupted the Greek Orders, the Doric and Ionic, they
developed and matured the Corinthian Order, and also worked out a
freer and more complex and comprehensive system of Architecture. To
say nothing of their introduction and application of those important
elements of both construction and design, the arch and vault—which
hardly belong to a mere treatise on the Orders—it is to the Romans
that we are indebted for varieties and combinations of plan that will
be sought for in vain among Grecian structures.</p>

<p>Of the Romans it may be said, “Mutant quadrata
<i>rotundis</i>,”—circular forms and curves displaying themselves
not only in elevation and section, but in plan; and while, among the
Greeks, Architecture was confined almost exclusively to external
appearance and effect, in the hands of the Romans it was made to
minister to internal display of the most enchantingly picturesque kind,
as would be amply attested by the Pantheon alone. In that edifice, and
Hadrian’s Mausoleum (now barbarized into the Castello di S. Angelo),
the cylindrical form was exhibited upon an imposing scale; in the
Temple at Tivoli, in far lesser dimensions, but with most captivating
taste; and again in the Tomb of Cæcilia Metella, we have a fine example
of an unbroken <i>astylar</i> circular mass. In such structures as the
Colosseum and other Roman Amphitheatres, a different form of curvature,
namely, the ellipsis, was employed with admirable propriety and effect.
In interiors, again, we find the hemicycle or concave semicircular form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
both frequently and variously applied by the Romans in such edifices as
their Baths, which afford many excellent studies for combinations of <i>plan</i>.</p>

<p>To enter into the system of Roman Architecture as the subject
itself would require, would very far exceed our present purpose and
limits; much less can we pretend to treat here of the still more
varied and complex Italian or Modern-European system, into which
<i>fenestration</i> so largely enters, <i>columniation</i> being,
more frequently than not, subordinate. Were we to touch upon the
last-mentioned style and its various elements, it could be only so
superficially as to be more disappointing than instructive. Better
that the reader should admire our forbearance than complain of our
unsatisfactory jejuneness. We may, however, permit ourselves to
throw out one or two general remarks; the first of which is, that
it is a great error to confound with the Italian the two Ancient
Classical styles, applying to them alike the epithet ‘Grecian,’
merely in contradistinction to Gothic or Mediæval Architecture. It is
absurd, too, to pretend to test by the Greek style, one so totally
differently constituted as the Italian; an error that could hardly
have been fallen into but for the practice of applying the same names
to very different things. The term ‘Order’ has quite a different
meaning, as applied to the original classical mode of the Art, from
what it has in the other. In Italian composition, an Order is more
frequently than not, mere decoration in the shape of columns and
entablatures, fashioned <i>secundum artem</i> (a very different thing
from <i>artistically</i>), so as to resemble in detail and certain
conventional distinctions those of the Ancients. Infinitely better
would it have been, if, instead of allowing themselves to be misled by
the pedantry of Vitruvius, the Architects of the so-called Revival, who
showed much happiness of invention in other respects, had treated the
Orders freely; or perhaps still better, had they worked out ideas of
their own for columns and entablatures, whenever they had occasion for
them either as matters of necessity, or as mere decoration. Had the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
Italians allowed themselves greater latitude in that respect, they
would, in all probability, have been far less licentious upon the whole
than they frequently were, and their buildings would have been more
homogeneous—more of a piece. But they must, forsooth, be Doric, Ionic,
or Corinthian, ofttimes all the three at once, and a very great deal
else into the bargain. Therefore the affecting to retain the ancient
Orders in their purity served no other purpose than that of making all
the more evident how completely their first intention and character had
been lost sight of.</p>

<p>The clinging with scrupulous punctilio to what had become dead-letter
forms after the system which had produced them had been abandoned and
exchanged for another and widely different one, was merely superstition
and pedantry. It might show acquaintance with traditional learning
and the writings of Vitruvius; but it also showed dulness of æsthetic
feeling, or, what is not much better, deficiency of æsthetic power.
There was, however, one mode of applying columns, which, although
generally regarded as the most licentious and unorthodox,—nay, even
preposterous, because quite contrary to all classical practice and
precedent,—has at least one propriety, that of being rational, since
columns there officiate as columns—as real supports; whereas in a
great deal of Modern Architecture that is admired for the correct
taste it displays, columns and their entablatures are mere expletives,
instead of actual component parts of the fabric, and simulate a mode of
construction neither required for nor practised in the fabric itself.
The particular mode here alluded to is that in which arches are not
only introduced together with columns, but the arches and columns
are so indissolubly married together that they cannot be divorced,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
inasmuch as the arches are supported by the columns themselves, the
former springing immediately from the capitals of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Such combination, it might be supposed, would be gladly admitted as
sufficiently legitimate, both because in accordance with rational
architectonic principles, and because it greatly extends the resources
of the Art; nevertheless, such is the omnipotence of prejudice, that
instead of being welcomed and adopted by us, it has been decried as
a barbarism. As an irresistible and crushing argument against it, we
are told that columns were not <i>originally</i> intended to be so
applied;—admirable logic, truly! There are a great many other things
besides columns which have in course of time come to be applied to
uses not originally contemplated. In regard to that combination of
columns and arches according to which the latter spring immediately
from the others, and are supported by them, there are two questions:
the first and practical one is; Do the columns afford sufficient
support?—the second and æsthetic one is; Is there also appearance of
sufficient support; or, is there any thing contradictory to principle,
to judgment, and good taste? The first question needs no answer,
since it answers itself, it being an indisputable fact that columns
so employed do answer the purpose to which they are turned. The other
question is not so easily answered: the prejudiced will of course
answer it according to their own contracted taste and narrow notions,
condemning the mode alluded to, without any inquiry into its merits and
advantages, merely on the ground of its being quite at variance with
the classical system of <i>trabeated</i> columniation, that is, with
columns supporting a horizontal architrave and entablature, or general
horizontal <i>trabeation</i>. That by the substitution of arches for
architraves, the character of the Greek system is forfeited, cannot be
denied; but then another character is established, whose difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
from the original one ought not to be made its condemnation. To demand
of a different mode that it should resemble and conform to the laws
of that from which it differs, is absurdity in the extreme, for it is
requiring that it should be at once a different one and the same. To
compare different styles is a very useful sort of study; but to make
any one style the criterion or standard by which others are to be
judged, is preposterous.</p>

<p>The style in which the arch and column enter into direct combination
with each other, and for which there is no specific name, has at all
events some economical recommendations, inasmuch as shorter columns,
and fewer of them, are required, than would be necessary for the same
height and length according to the trabeated mode. In itself, too,
it possesses much ‘capability;’ yet, as is the case with every other
style, the merit of the works produced in it depends upon the manner in
which it is treated, and the talent brought to it. There is no style of
the Art so poetical that the flattest prose may not be made out of it;
and hardly any so utterly prosaic as to be incapable of being kindled
into poetry by the Promethean torch of geniality—artistic treatment,
and, <i>con amore</i>, æsthetic feeling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTERCOL">INTERCOLUMNIATION.</h2>

<p>Although Intercolumniation consists only in regulating and determining
the spaces between the columns, and consequently does not affect the
nature of the composition,—for a tetrastyle, hexastyle, &amp;c., would
still be such, no matter how narrow or wide the <i>intercolumns</i> or
intervals between the columns may be,—very much depends upon it, with
regard to expression and effect. How intercolumniation is regulated in
the Doric Order has been already explained at page 20: in that, the
distances between the columns is governed entirely by the triglyphs of
the frieze, so that there can be no medium between <i>monotriglyphic
and ditriglyphic</i> intercolumniation, accordingly as there is either
one or two triglyphs over each intercolumn. But in the other Orders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
there is no such restriction; in them the intercolumns may be made
wider or narrower, as circumstances require, but of course under
the guidance of judgment and good taste; for what is left <i>à
discrétion</i> is not always very discreetly used. Vitruvius and his
followers, however, have not cared to trust to individual discretion
or indiscretion, but have fixed certain positive and distinct modes
of intercolumniation, viz. five,—perhaps out of compliment to the
<i>five</i> Orders, to wit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">Pycnostyle, or <i>closely set</i>, in which the
intercolumns are one diameter and a quarter, or a half, in width.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Systyle, in which they are two diameters wide.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Eustyle, or <i>well spaced</i>, in which they are
two diameters and a half.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Diastyle, in which they are three diameters.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Aræostyle, or <i>thinly set</i>, in which they
are four diameters.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us repudiate for Architecture all such formal act-of-parliament
legislation, and take pycnostyle and aræostyle as the greatest
allowable degree of closeness or of distance at which the columns can
be placed; and it follows that between such maximum and minimum any
intermediate measure is admissible, and that there is no occasion to
fix it positively and arithmetically, and make distinctions which are,
after all, only arbitrary. There are a great many matters in design
which must be left to the Architect, and intercolumniation is one of
them. It is not possible to have precise rules for every thing, neither
is it desirable; for if every thing in it could be done by rule,
Architecture would forfeit its nature as one of the Fine Arts, and be
reduced to a merely mechanical one. What is done by rule can be done by
one man just as well as by another.</p>

<p>Excepting the terms pycnostyle and aræostyle, which are useful
as expressing the greatest degree of closeness or of openness of
intercolumniation consistent with well-proportioned arrangement, the
others may be dispensed with. To designate one mode as <i>eustyle</i>,
<i>par excellence</i>, is very much like saying that the proportions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
assigned to it, viz. 2·30′ or 2½ diameters, are the very best, and all
the rest comparatively defective; according to which doctrine, the
<i>monotriglyphic</i> mode of intercolumniation usually employed by
the Greeks in their Doric temples, and which answers to the character
of pycnostyle, is not so well proportioned as what is emphatically
called eustyle. Let it be whatever it may, as expressed in terms of
the diameter of the columns, intercolumniation should always deserve
the name of eustyle, or <i>well-proportioned</i>, by being such as
satisfies the eye, and contributes to the particular character that
befits the occasion and harmonizes with the other proportions of the
structure. Pycnostyle, or <i>close spacing</i>, carries with it the
expression of both richness and strength, the solids or columns being
very little less than the voids or intercolumns. Aræostyle, or <i>wide
spacing</i>,—and <i>ditriglyphic</i> Doric intercolumniation may be
called such,—produces an effect of openness and lightness, but also
partakes of meagreness and weakness, owing to the want of sufficient
apparent support for the entablature,—a very frequent fault in Modern
Architecture, where frugality as to columniation has often been allowed
to produce a degree of poverty which contrasts very disagreeably with
that of the decoration affected by the Order itself. Intercolumniation
ought to be made to depend in some measure upon the nature of the
composition: a tetrastyle portico, for instance, or a distyle in
antis, admits of wider intercolumniation than would be suitable for an
octastyle, because pycnostyle, where there are only three intercolumns,
would produce too great narrowness of general proportions for a portico.</p>

<p>Hardly is there need for observing, that be their proportions what they
may, the intercolumns in a colonnade or portico must be all alike;
nevertheless in a Grecian Doric portico there is, as we have seen, some
difference, the two extreme intercolumns being there narrower by the
width of half a triglyph. There is, besides, another exception from
the general principle, for the centre intercolumn of a portico was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
frequently made somewhat wider than the others, in order to mark the
entrance, and the better to display and afford greater space for access
to the door within.</p>

<p>One mode of columniation and intercolumniation which remains to be
spoken of, is that which has sometimes been practised by Modern
Architects, and combines the two extremes of pycnostyle, or still
closer intercolumniation, and aræostyle. This consists in coupling the
columns and making a wide intercolumn between every pair of columns,
so that as regards the average proportion between solids and voids,
that disposition does not differ from what it would be were the columns
placed singly. Although denounced by some critics, more especially
Algarotti, as altogether licentious and indefensible, and although it
is not to be especially recommended, or indeed practicable on every
occasion, the coupling of columns may, under some circumstances, be not
only excusable, but advisable and proper. As is the case with almost
every thing else in matters of art, all depends upon <i>how</i> it is
done, and whether with or without sufficient reason. That there is
no classical authority for it, is no valid reason against it; in the
constitution of the ancient temples there was nothing to require or
<i>motive</i> it. It may be conceded, however, that coupled columns,
forming a prostyle surmounted by a pediment, are objectionable; because
where so strong a resemblance to the antique model is preserved in
other respects, a departure from it in regard to the disposition of the
columns has a disagreeably disturbing effect.</p>

<p>Having gone through the Classical Orders, and explained their elements
and constitution, we have performed as much as we purposed, or as we
promised. Within the same compass we might, no doubt, have touched
upon a great deal besides that belongs to the study of Greek and
Roman Architecture, by restricting ourselves to bare matter-of-fact,
and suppressing all comment, and so treating the subject drily and
superficially. Proceeding upon the principle of <i>multum haud
multa</i>, we have aimed at nothing more than to initiate the reader in
such manner as to excite interest in the subject, and stimulate to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
further inquiry. Should we have effected that, and should we have
disabused him of the prejudices and contracted notions generally
entertained in regard to the Orders, or else armed him against them,
we shall have accomplished the <i>multum</i>—the main point of all.
<i>Much</i> shall we have taught, and much will he have learnt,
should he now reject the fatal doctrine of the Five Orders, and
relinquish it to school-boys and school-masters,—to the plodders who
work by pattern, and design by rote and by routine. Much, very much
indeed, will have been learnt, by the reader, should he have learnt
or have been put in the way of learning, to look upon those various
compositions in the three several styles of columniation, which are
called Orders, not with the eyes of a Builder or a Mechanic, but with
the intuition and the feeling of an Artist; in short, to look upon them
as general <i>types</i> to be diligently studied, and then imitated
with congenial gusto.

<p>We here make one alphabetical arrangement serve the double purpose
of an Index referring to the pages where the respective matters are
treated of, and of a Glossary affording explanation, or further remark,
as may be, where required. This latter is by no means to be considered
a complete or general Glossary of Architectural Terms, but merely as an
accompaniment to the present Treatise, and a specimen, perhaps, of what
is still a desideratum, namely, a <i>real Lexicon</i>—that is, one
which explains <i>things</i> as well as terms—of Ancient and Modern
Architecture, similar to what has been provided with regard to the
Mediæval Styles of the Art.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"> <span class="smcap">Abacus.</span>—The
<i>plate</i> or shallow block forming the uppermost member of a capital
is so called for the sake of distinction, for when a similar one is
placed beneath the base of a column, it is called a <i>plinth</i>.
The Doric abacus is spoken of at <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>, and is here
shown in a plan of the capital and architrave; <i>a a a a</i> being the angles
of the soffit or underside of the abacus which overhang the echinus <i>e e
e e</i>; and <i>s s</i> the soffit of the architrave. From this, the
relation between the abacus and architrave, and how much the former
exceeds or projects out beyond the latter, will be better understood
than by the engraving at <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>, where the capital
is shown only in <i>elevation</i>. </p>

<p class="blockquot">The <a href="#I_83A">next figure</a> is still more indispensable for

Here the abacus shows itself only in front at <i>f f</i>, over the two voluted faces, the
rest being concealed by the baluster sides <i>b b</i> of the capital,
which extend beyond the abacus, and convert the general plan into more
than a square. Although the channels and other details of the baluster
sides are omitted, and only their general shape shown, the engraving
explains how those sides are <i>reduced</i> (<a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>)

curvature is given to the abacus itself on all its four sides; the
capital of this Third Order having that in common with the First one,
that it is quite regular. One great point of difference between the
Doric and Corinthian abacus is, that in the former the angles are
unsupported, and overhang the circular body of the capital, while in
the Corinthian they are extended outwards diagonally, as <i>a a a a</i>
in the figure, and supported by the <i>caulicoli</i> or small volutes,
which they in turn serve to cover. The letters <i>f f f f</i> indicate
the rosettes or flowers on the four faces of the abacus.

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Æsthetics—Æsthetic.</span>—A
modern architectural writer condemns these terms as ‘silly and
pedantic’ ones that have ‘lately come into use in the Arts,’ and as
‘useless additions to the nomenclature’ and language of art-criticism.
In what respect ‘Æsthetics’ is at all more pedantic than ‘Optics,’
‘Mathematics,’ ‘Physics,’ and other words of a similar class now
familiar to English ears,—although they are all of them essentially
Greek,—or more pedantic than a great many architectural terms which
are not only Greek but altogether technical, it is not easy to divine;
while as to silliness, there seems to be far greater silliness in
rejecting, or objecting to, than in adopting terms which are not only
highly expressive and convenient, but have found their way into every
European language, from that of Russia to that of Spain.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The term Æsthetics implies the perception and the
study of those qualities which constitute the beautiful and artistic,
and form the finer essence of all productions of Fine Art. It carries
with it, therefore, a more exact and philosophic meaning than the word
Taste. In its adjective form, in which it more frequently occurs, it
is particularly useful, as no adequate epithet can be substituted
for ‘Æsthetic.’ Thus we speak of the ‘æsthetic sense,’ of ‘æsthetic
feeling,’ or ‘study,’ or ‘principles,’ &amp;c.; but we cannot say the
‘tasteful sense,’ or ‘tasteful study.’ As to the species of study just
alluded to, no term may be required to designate it, because study of
the kind is generally dispensed with for Architecture, an historical
and technical knowledge of it being deemed sufficient, without any
acquaintance with those comprehensive <i>æsthetic</i> principles of the
Art which can guide us where technical rules stop short, and mere rules
abandon us to error or to doubt.</p>

to separate the capital from the shaft of a column.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Astylar.</span>—From the
Greek privative α, and στύλος (stylos), a column: columnless or without
columns, a term that expresses the absence of columns or pilasters,
where they might otherwise be supposed to occur.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Attic.</span>—This is usually
defined to be a small Order placed over a principal one; from which
it might be supposed that it differed from the Orders in general
chiefly by being applied on a smaller scale; instead of which it has
nothing of columniation and trabeation in it. There is far greater
analogy between an attic and a stylobate, or continuous pedestal, both
of them consisting of base, a dado or die, and a simple cornice, and
the difference between them consisting chiefly in their application,
the stylobate being below, and the attic above the Order. Attics are
either plain or pilastered accordingly as the building itself is
astylar or the contrary; but what are called attic pilasters are no
more than slight <i>breaks</i> or projections on the general surface,
with the mouldings above and below breaking round them, without any
sort of capital, but just after the manner of pedestals: their faces,
however, are sometimes distinguished from the intermediate surfaces by
being panelled and otherwise enriched, as is done, for instance, in
the façade of the new Treasury Buildings: another mode of decoration
is to place either a statue, or else a caryatid figure, before each
break in the front of the Attic, an example of which occurs in the
Strand front of Somerset House. When introduced only over particular
portions of a façade, such as the centre or extremities, the Attic is
an exceedingly useful element in composition, inasmuch as it serves not
only to give such parts greater importance, but also to produce play
of outline or sky-line; whereas, if continued throughout, it is apt to
produce heaviness as well as monotony, and some degree of feebleness
of expression also, its cornice forming, in comparison with the principal
cornice below, but a very insignificant finish to the general structure.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Axis.</span>—An imaginary
line through the centre of a column, &amp;c., or its geometrical
representation. Where different members are placed over each other, so
that the same vertical line, on the elevation, divides them equally,
they are said to be on the same axis, although they may be on different
planes. Thus, triglyphs and modillions are so arranged that one
coincides with the axis or line of axis of each column. In like manner,
the windows or other openings in the several stories of a façade must
all be in the same respective axis, whether they are all of the same
breadth or not.

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Bed-Mouldings.</span>—This
may be understood as a collective term for all the mouldings beneath
the corona or principal projecting member of a cornice, which, without
bed-mouldings, would appear too much like a mere shelf.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Cabled</span> fluting, <a href="#Page_60">60</a>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Capital.</span>—The capitals
of the columns constitute the principal and most obvious indicial mark
of the respective Orders. For those of each of the Three Classes or
Orders a certain character conformably with the rest of the Order is to
be observed; but that attended to, further restriction is unnecessary.
Between several examples, all decidedly referable to one and the same
Order, very great special differences occur, and there might easily be
a very great many more. Although the capital itself is indispensable,
it is so only <i>æsthetically</i>, and not out of positive necessity.
The necessity is only artistic: decoration of the kind there must be,
but the express mode of it is one of those matters which should be
left to design, to which it properly belongs. Capitals are just as
legitimate subjects for the exercise of taste and invention as any
thing else in decorative design. The capital is only an ornamental head
to the column, and therefore admits of being as freely designed as
any other piece of ornament, on the conditions of its being accordant
in character with the rest of the Order, and of forming an agreeable
transition from the shaft of the column to the architrave.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span
class="smcap">Caryatides.</span>—Anthropostylar pillars or human
figures (usually female ones) employed instead of columns to support an
entablature. Such figures ought always to be perfectly free from all
<i>attitudinizing</i>, and to appear to support their burden without
any effort. Some very matter-of-fact critics object to caryatides as
being at the best only beautiful absurdities; as if statues so applied
were particularly liable to be mistaken for living persons subjected to
a more severe punishment than that of being posted up in a niche, or on
the top of a building.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Corona.</span>—That part
or member of a cornice which projects out over and protects the
bed-mouldings (see <i>Bed-Mouldings</i>), and throws off the rain from
the rest of the entablature.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Cymatium.</span>—A moulding
whose section or profile is convex below and concave above. See <i>Mouldings</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Dado.</span>—The general
plane surface of a pedestal or stylobate between the upper and lower
mouldings.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Dentels.</span>—The series of
small upright blocks introduced among the bed-mouldings of a cornice.
They are supposed to be peculiarly characteristic of the Ionic cornice,
but are also employed for the Corinthian one, beneath the modillions,
which latter are the principal characteristic of the Corinthian
cornice, as dentels alone of the Ionic.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Diameter.</span>—The lower
diameter of the column is taken as the <i>proportional</i> measure for
all the other parts and members of an Order, for which purpose it is
subdivided into 60 parts, called minutes, or into two <i>modules</i> of
30 minutes each; but the module is quite an unnecessary distinction,
not being, like the diameter, the constant measure of any one member of
the Order, and the use of it merely adding to the terms of computation.
It is surely much more simple and convenient to write 1·40′, meaning 1
diameter and 40 minutes, than 1d. 1m. 10′. Being proportional measures,
diameters and minutes are not fixed ones, like feet and inches, but
are variable as to the actual dimensions which they express—larger or
smaller, according to the actual size of the diameter of the column.
For instance, if the diameter be just 5 feet, a minute, being ¹/₆₀,
will be exactly 1 inch; if 2½ feet, the minute will be half an inch; or
if the diameter be only one foot, the minute is ¹/₆₀ of a foot, or ⅕ of
an inch.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Die.</span>—See <i>Dado</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Dimensions.</span>—In
architectural description, some positive dimensions or approximation
to them should always be stated. Such mere epithets as <i>large</i>,
<i>lofty</i>, <i>spacious</i>, &amp;c., mean nothing,—convey only an
exceedingly vague, general idea according to the particular notions of
those who employ them; and, like all epithets, they are liable to the
most shameful abuse.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Echinus.</span>—A large
convex moulding, generally of elliptical or eccentric contour in the
Greek style, and forming the quarter of a circle in the Roman. The
echinus is the indicial mark of and constitutes the principal portion
of the Doric capital, the other being the abacus; at least the term
echinus is applied especially to that member of the capital, although
in many Greek examples its profile has scarcely any convexity, but
more resembles a portion of an inverted cone (18). In Roman and Modern
Architecture the echinus is usually called the <i>ovolo</i>. See <i>Mouldings</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Elevation</span> may be
defined to be the <i>upright plan</i> of a building, or any part
of a building, showing its exact form and dimensions as they actually
exist; whereas in perspective the forms are shown not as they exist,
or are in themselves, but merely as they appear to the eye, according
to the station of the spectator. Elevations are of two kinds, viz.
<i>geometrical</i> and <i>perspective</i>. In the former, the whole is
projected upon the same <i>plane</i>, the remote parts are shown of
their full size, and distance can be expressed only by shadow thrown
upon the second plane by parts in the nearest one; whereas Perspective
elevation partakes of parallel perspective, and the parts beyond the
first plane are shown diminished by distance, and also come into view,
although they may be behind others on the first plane by which they
would be concealed in a geometrical representation. For instance,
supposing a portico to have a second row of columns in the same axes
as those in front, that circumstance would not be at all apparent in
a geometrical elevation, but could be understood only by means of the
plan, the inner columns being concealed by those before them; but in
a perspective elevation they would show themselves, as would also the
ceiling and floor.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Entablature.</span>—The
horizontal portion of an Order; the <i>trabeation</i> or system of
beams supported by the columns. There may, however, be entablature
without columns,—where the latter are suppressed, as on the flanks of
an <i>apteral</i> temple; or omitted entirely, as in <i>astylar</i>
building. For the entablatures of the respective Orders, see pages
<a href="#Page_18">18</a>, <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, <a href="#Page_60">60</a>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Entasis.</span>—A slightly
convex curvature given in execution to the outline of the shaft of a
column, just sufficient to counteract and correct the appearance, or
fancied appearance, of curvature in a contrary direction (<i>i. e.</i>
concavely), which might else take place and cause the middle of the
shaft to appear thinner than it really is. Entasis is therefore nothing
<i>positive</i>: it is not intended to show itself, for were it to do
so,—were there to be any visible swelling,—it would be a deformity; yet
such deformity has been studiously adopted by many Modern Architects,
merely, it would seem, for the sake of making evident that at all
events they took pains to guard against an imaginary defect. The
subject of entasis has been made one of those <i>nugæ difficiles</i>
which those who can do nothing else make great parade with. To such,
then, be left all such sublimated transcendental niceties. If a column
only 30 or 40 feet high would appear thinner in the middle than it
really is, unless there made somewhat thicker than it would be were its
profile a straight line, the same appearance would take place in any
other lofty object, and in a greater degree in proportion to actual
height; so that a tower of great loftiness, both positively and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
proportionally, <i>ought</i>—unless entasis were given it, to look
thinner in the middle than at top and bottom. If such appearance really
does take place, it is one perfectly in accordance with the laws of
vision, therefore no more than a natural and perfectly proper one. In
all such cases the judgment corrects the eye, and prevents mistakes. It
would, in fact, require a very great stretch of imagination to fancy
what we know to be straight, and of the same breadth throughout, is not
so: if we can fancy that, we can also fancy that the further end of a
building is not so high as the nearer one, and that instead of being
horizontal, the cornices slope downwards. So much for the fuss made
about entasis, including that about the hypothetical curvature in the
horizontal lines of the Parthenon, where curvature was administered, if
administered at all, in an exceedingly homœopathic ratio.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Epistylium.</span>—The
architrave or horizontal course resting immediately upon the columns.
Hence we should denote as <i>Epistylar Arcuation</i> that system in
which columns support arches instead of horizontal architraves and
entablatures. <a href="#Page_75">See p. 75</a>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Epitithedas.</span>—A term
applied by some writers, by way of distinction, to the cymatium
on the sloping or <i>raking</i> cornices of a pediment, which
<i>superimposed</i> moulding (as its name implies) was frequently
largely developed, and enriched with an ornamental pattern.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Fenestration</span>, termed
by the Germans <i>Fenster-architektur</i>, is, in contradistinction
from columniation, the system of construction and mode of design
marked by windows. Fenestration and Columniation are so far
antagonistic and irreconcileable, that fenestration either interferes
with the effect aimed at by columniation with insulated columns, as
in a portico or colonnade, or reduces it, as is the case with an
engaged Order, to something quite secondary and merely decorative.
Astylar and Fenestrated ought, therefore, to be merely convertible
terms; but as they are not, we may be allowed to invent that of
<i>columnar-fenestrated</i>, to denote that mode of composition which
unites fenestration with the <i>semblance</i>, at least, of the other.
Employed as a collective term, Fenestration serves to express the
character of a building or design with regard to the windows generally:
thus we say, the Fenestration is excellent, or the contrary,—ornate or
meagre,—well arranged or too crowded,—which last circumstance is a very
common fault, and is destructive both of grandeur and of repose. <i>Si
quæris exemplum, circumspice.</i></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Fillet.</span>—Any narrow
flat moulding or surface is so termed. Fillets are used either to
separate or finish other mouldings. The intervals or spaces between
the flutes on the shaft of a column are also called fillets, although
not actual members, but merely the surface left between the hollowed
channels or flutes themselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Fluting.</span>—The
collective term for the channels cut on the shafts of columns.
Hitherto this has been restricted to little more than two modes, viz.
with arrises or sharp ridges, as in the Doric Order (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>),
or with fillets. A different mode of <i>striating</i> the shafts of columns is
described at <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>, and many others might easily
be devised.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Frieze.</span>—The middle one
of the three divisions of an entablature. It derives its name from the
Italian <i>Fregio</i>, ornament, as being that part of the entablature
especially appropriate for sculptural embellishment, yet, in
contradiction to such signification, the frieze is all but invariably
made a mere plain surface by Modern Architects; except the Order
employed happens to be Doric, and then triglyphs are introduced as
matter of course, but the metopes left blank, even though ornateness is
studied in other respects, and in parts not comprehended in the Order
itself. For the Ionic Order, Modern Architects have sometimes employed
the so-called <i>pulvinated</i> frieze (<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>), that is,
one whose face is curved convexly; but upon what principle they have appropriated
such form of the frieze to that Order in particular, when it is just as
suitable for the Corinthian, is not said, and not to be guessed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Hypotrachelium.</span>—The
necking of a capital introduced between the capital itself and the
shaft of the column. In the Grecian Doric, the hypotrachelium is little
more than nominal, being marked only by one or more horizontal channels
or incisions, and the flutings continued through them; whereas to the
Modern Doric capital a distinct necking is given by the astragal which
separates the capital from the shaft, and marks its commencement. But
that is considered an essential part of the capital, and as to the
Corinthian capital it does not admit of any necking; wherefore the
Ionic one possesses a great advantage over either of them, inasmuch as
it may have a distinct necking or not, and it may be either plain or
enriched.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Intercolumn</span> and
<span class="smcap">Intercolumniation</span>.—The subject of
Intercolumniation is treated of at <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>, &amp;c.
These two terms are generally confounded together; or rather, the
second is very improperly substituted for the other, contrary to
all analogy of language and distinctness of meaning. Having only
a general collective import, <i>Intercolumniation</i> can, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
<i>Columniation</i>, be used only in the singular. We may say of a
portico, &amp;c., that its intercolumniation is good or poor, close or
straggling, but not that it consists of so many intercolumniations
(according as the number may be), since such mode of expression is no
better than a solecistical vulgarism. We might just as well describe a
tetrastyle portico as having four <i>columniations</i>, as say that it
has three <i>intercolumniations</i>.</p>

instance, were filled in with sculpture; but in modern porticoes that
pique themselves upon being <i>after the Parthenon</i>, they are mere
blanks.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Minute.</span>—The sixtieth
part of the diameter of the column as a proportional measure. Minutes
are written thus, 10′, <i>i. e.</i> ten minutes.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Modillion.</span>—The small

termed <i>modillions</i>. <a href="#Page_61">See page 61</a>.</p>

horizontal cornice below and two sloping or raking cornices.

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Pilaster.</span>—Unknown to
Greek Architecture, in which only antæ (see <i>Antæ</i>) were admitted:
Pilasters are employed by the Moderns as substitutes for an Order in
engaged columns, and are, perhaps, even preferable to the latter,
inasmuch as they combine better and more naturally with the wall to
which they are attached.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Plan.</span>—A plan may
be familiarly described as an architectural <i>map</i>, or map of a
building: therefore only those who cannot comprehend a geographical or
topographical map—a degree of obtuseness hardly credible—can be at any
loss to understand an architectural one, the latter being precisely
of the same nature as the others, with this difference in its favour,
that it is much less conventional. To define it more exactly,—a plan
is a <i>horizontal section</i> supposed to be taken on the level
of the floor through the solid parts of the fabric—walls, columns,
&amp;c., so as to show their various thicknesses and situations, the
dimensions of the several spaces or rooms, the position of the doors
by which they communicate with each other, and various particulars
that cannot otherwise be explained. Studying buildings without plans
is like studying geography without maps. Nevertheless, most persons
ignore—affect a genteel ignorance of such vulgar and technical drawings
as plans. Plan frequently costs the Architect more study than all
the rest of his design. Very much mistaken are they who suppose that
convenience alone has chiefly to be considered. Convenience is, of
course, or ought to be, made a <i>sine quâ non</i>; yet it is not so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
much a positive merit in itself, as the want of it is a positive
defect. Mere convenience is not an artistic quality: from that to
beauty of plan,—to striking combinations, and studied effects, and
varied play of arrangement, the distance is very great. A common-place
plan is but a very dull uninteresting affair. It is no more than what
any builder can accomplish; but a plan replete with imagination,
piquant play, and well-imagined contrasts, is no every-day matter.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Podium.</span>—A continued

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Polystyle.</span>—Having
a number of columns. Where columns occur behind columns, as where
a portico has inner columns, like that of the Royal Exchange, such
portico may be termed <i>polystyle</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Porch.</span>—Any small
portico considerably lower than the main structure to which it is
attached may be so termed, in contradistinction from one carried up the
height of the building, or as high as the principal cornice.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Portico.</span>—For the
different plans and denominations of porticoes, <a href="#Page_69">see p. 69</a>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Profile.</span>—The outline
of a series of mouldings, or of any other parts, as shown by a section
through them.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Proportion.</span>—The
magnitude of one part as compared with some other. The term
‘proportion’ is used absolutely in the sense of ‘good proportion;’
although every thing that has shape has proportions of some kind
or other. The subject of Proportions has been greatly mystified by
writers who have laid down certain fixed proportions as the best of
all on every occasion, and as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of artistic
taste. But fixed proportions can be followed mechanically by every
one alike; whereas it requires ability to deviate successfully from
routine measurement, and apply the <i>poco piu</i> or the <i>poco
meno</i> as the particular occasion or the particular effect aimed at
may require—at least justify. It is the eye that takes cognizance of
proportions; and the Architect’s own eye ought to be quite as correct
as that of other people.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Prostyle.</span>—A portico
which projects from the body of a building, or the rest of a façade.

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Pulvinated.</span>—A frieze
whose face is convex instead of plain is said to be <i>pulvinated</i>,

out when pressed upon. <a href="#Page_50">See page 50</a>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Raking Cornices.</span>—A

the sloping sides of a pediment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Rustication.</span>—Although
Rustication is not spoken of in this treatise, the term is here
inserted for the purpose of remarking that what is so called might
frequently be more correctly described as <i>Decorative Masonry</i>,
since, so far from expressing rudeness or coarseness, it may be made
to display the most studied nicety and elaborate finish. Rustication,
no doubt, originated in a very rude mode of construction; but what
was at first clumsiness and irregularity, was afterwards refined into
an artful and symmetrical disposition of the stones and courses of
masonry, by a similar æsthetic process to that which converted the
original amorphous stone pillar into the Doric column. To call such
masonry, as some have done, only <i>cicatrizing</i> and <i>gashing</i>,
betrays a loss for both arguments and words. Decorative masonry is most
assuredly not according to Greek taste or practice; for the Greeks
affected to suppress the appearance of <i>articulation</i> in masonry,
and thereby to give their buildings, as far as possible, the look of
not being <i>fabricated</i>, but <i>carved</i> out of one block of
solid material. Yet it does not therefore follow that the other mode
of decidedly articulating and pronouncing the joints and courses of
the stones is bad, because it is an opposite one. So far from being
unæsthetic, it possesses much that recommends it artistically, for it
gives <i>colour</i>, and produces richness of surface where there would
else be blankness. A wall whose face is so decorated forms an admirable
ground to columns or pilasters, which it serves to relieve very
effectively, as is exemplified in the screen façade of Dover House,
that little architectural gem by Holland, which, though by no means
faultless, has more of genuine artistic quality than any other building
of its time in the whole Metropolis.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Section.</span>—A vertical

upon an upright plane <i>cutting through it</i>. Though rarely shown,
sections are almost as indispensable as plans, like which, they show
the thicknesses of the walls; and in addition those of the ceilings and
floors; and show also <i>heights</i>, both of the rooms themselves,
and of doors and windows;—moreover, the forms of the ceilings, whether
flat, or coved, or vaulted. In one respect, too, a section partakes of
the nature of an elevation, the plane parallel to the line of section
being an elevation of the interior, or rather consisting of as many
elevations as there are separate rooms or divisions. Sections may be
described as either <i>furnished</i> or <i>unfurnished</i>; the former
show only construction and the strictly architectural parts, wherefore,
if the side of a room happens to be quite plain, without door,
chimney-piece, or other feature, that side or space will be a blank, or
little better. Furnished sections, on the contrary, exhibit, besides
what strictly belongs to the Architecture and its decoration, mirrors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
pictures, statues, furniture, draperies, and all other accessories.
The number of sections required depends upon the nature of the plan,
and what there is worth showing. If the design be worthy of it, there
should be as many sections as will suffice to show every side of every
principal apartment; though it may not be necessary to repeat the
entire section through every floor. Sections are the <i>deliciæ</i> of
architectural illustration, and, it would seem, far too precious to be
frequently exhibited.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Soffit.</span>—From the
Italian <i>soffitto</i>, a ceiling; the under surface of any projecting
moulding or member.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Style</span>, in the sense
of a column (from the Greek στύλος, a column), enters into a great
number of useful compound terms referring to matters connected with
columniation, and which may here be grouped together, so that any
word ending in ‘style’ may be found here, though passed over in its
alphabetical order. The number of columns in the front of a pedimented
portico is briefly expressed at once by any of the following terms:</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Macrostyle denotes a large Order, that is, one
forming the height of the building.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Microstyle, on the contrary, denotes a lesser
Order, belonging only to some low division of the building, as for
instance, a porch. Thus porticoes are <i>macrostylar</i>, porches

<p>It is proposed to publish, in 20 Monthly Parts, this very important
work, to contain 180 plates and 800 pages of letterpress description of
the Public Buildings of London. Each Part will contain 9 plates and 40

at an extremely small charge, and published at such intervals as to be
convenient for all classes, entitled</p>

THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS OF LONDON:</p>

<p class="f90 space-above2">Originally edited by the late <span class="smcap">Augustus Pugin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Jos. Gwilt</span>, <span class="smcap">Britton</span>, and others.</p>

<p class="center space-below2">NEWLY EDITED AND ENLARGED BY W. H. LEEDS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Manifold as are the publications which represent the various
structures of the metropolis, this is the only work which describes
them, not <i>ad libitum</i>, in views which, even when perfectly
correct, show no more than the general aspect and locality of
each building from a certain point, and consequently afford no
information beyond mere external appearance—but exhibits them
<i>architecturally</i> by means of plans, elevations, and occasionally
both sections and interior perspective views. Thus a far more complete
and correct knowledge may be obtained of each edifice, in its entire
arrangement in all its parts and dimensions, than by pictorial views of
them.</p>

<p>As studies for the Architect, the subjects contained in these
volumes strongly recommend themselves,—more particularly so, as of
the majority of them no plans and elevations are to be met with in
any other publication, which materially enhances the interest of this
collection, and it preserves to us authentic and tolerably complete
records of many buildings which no longer exist. Among these are <span
class="smcap">Carlton House</span>, illustrated with several plates,
including sections, and a plan of the private apartments; the late
<span class="smcap">English Opera House</span>; <span class="smcap">Mr.
Nash’s Gallery</span>, which has since been dismantled of its
embellishments; <span class="smcap">The Royal Exchange</span>, and the
<span class="smcap">Board of Trade</span>.</p>

<p>Among the new subjects introduced in this new edition will be
found:—The New Plan and Elevation of the <span class="smcap">British
Museum</span>—<span class="smcap">New Houses of Parliament</span>—<span
class="smcap">Royal Exchange</span>—<span class="smcap">Army and Navy

The necessity for agreement in this respect between the column and
its entablature will be rendered apparent by the preposterous effect
produced in two instances where the columns have been prolonged to
an absurd height without the entablature being deepened in the same
degree; namely, the portico of the Admiralty, and that within the court
of Furnival’s Inn; the first of which is bad enough, the other far
worse in every respect.</p></div>

We place these examples according to their respective proportional
heights, beginning with the highest, and descending to the lowest, and
note their measurements in <i>minutes</i> rather than in diameters
and fractional parts, as being the most direct and convenient mode
of comparison. The height of the capital is taken exclusive of the
astragal which divides it from the shaft of the column; and as the
<i>expansion</i> of the capital upwards has also to be considered, the
extreme width of the abacus is also indicated.</p>

<p>The porticoes marked with the * are simple prostyles, or
<i>monoprostyle</i>, advancing only a single intercolumn forwarder
than the rest of the building; while the others are <i>diprostyle</i>,
or show two open intercolumns on their flanks; except Hanover Chapel,
whose portico is partly prostyle and partly recessed, and that of the
India House, which is entirely recessed, although its elevation is not
a composition <i>in antis</i>; had it been such, it would have been a
<i>tetrastyle in antis</i>, that and a hexastyle having the same number
of intercolumns, viz. five.</p></div>

Should the reader be quite fresh to the subject, he is recommended
to draw out for himself,—merely roughly mark down,—the several
dispositions of columns which have been spoken of; for by compelling
him to consider them carefully, he will be better able to understand
them, and have them distinctly impressed upon his memory. The annexed
may serve as a specimen of such short-hand architectural notation, in
asterisks.</p>

This mode of uniting together columns and arches is perfectly
legitimate, whereas that in which a fragment of the usual entablature
is left sticking or added to each column, (as, for instance, in the
interior of St. Martin’s Church,) is decidedly solecistical, since
it is injuriously reminiscent of <i>epistylar</i> construction or
trabeation,—is in itself unmeaning, and causes the columns to appear
to have been too short, and therefore to have been eked out in height
by blocks upon them, fashioned to resemble so many detached bits of an
entablature.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
